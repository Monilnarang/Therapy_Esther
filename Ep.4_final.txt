Speaker 1:  Welcome to the Audible Original Series, Where Should We Begin, with Esther Perel.
Speaker 1:  There's more Esther coming soon. Season 2 of this series and her new audiobook, The State of Affairs.
Speaker 1:  Learn more at audible.com slash Esther. That's audible.com slash E-S-T-H-E-R.
Speaker 2:  This Audible Original contains mature themes. Listener discretion is advised.
Speaker 3:  I wish he would have been a gambler, a drug addict, anything but sex.
Speaker 2:  What you're about to hear is an unscripted, one-time couples counseling session.
Speaker 2:  For the purposes of maintaining confidentiality, all names and identifiable characteristics have been removed.
Speaker 2:  But their voices and their stories are real.
Speaker 4:  I thought I had the perfect marriage.
Speaker 4:  After 36 years, I found out that my husband had been cheating on me from probably the week we were married.
Speaker 4:  I was totally blown away.
Speaker 5:  From a very early age, I was sexually abused as a kid.
Speaker 5:  And it also came from a very abusive family, physically abusive.
Speaker 5:  Sex became a way out.
Speaker 5:  I call it visual aids.
Speaker 5:  There was never an emotional attachment.
Speaker 5:  Mostly one night stands and pay for play.
Speaker 6:  It's one thing to meet a couple where there was a one-off affair or a two-year or three-year or five-year affair even.
Speaker 6:  But this couple is decades of prolific, compulsive dalliances.
Speaker 6:  It asks the question, what kind of marriage did these people have?
Speaker 6:  And yet, this is a woman who says, my husband, I know he loved me.
Speaker 3:  He was a good husband.
Speaker 3:  He was always home.
Speaker 3:  He was always, he was the best father ever.
Speaker 3:  Always there with our children.
Speaker 3:  Always loving to me.
Speaker 3:  I never knew anything was wrong.
Speaker 5:  The way I feel about her never changed.
Speaker 5:  I love her.
Speaker 5:  And I always, I mean, looked out for her.
Speaker 5:  We shared everything.
Speaker 6:  Both of them come in with a definition of what has happened to him.
Speaker 6:  And that definition is that this is a man with a sex addiction.
Speaker 3:  The first time we sat in with a professional and they said sex addiction.
Speaker 3:  And then they used compulsion.
Speaker 3:  And it was like, what's the difference?
Speaker 6:  And what would be the difference for you?
Speaker 3:  It almost makes it better to know that it was an addiction because that's an illness.
Speaker 3:  Compulsion is control.
Speaker 7:  Better for me to say I'm an asshole than I'm sick.
Speaker 7:  Because once an addict, always an addict.
Speaker 7:  If you're an asshole, you can learn.
Speaker 7:  You're not an asshole anymore.
Speaker 6:  There's a lot of questions about the diagnosis of addiction at this point.
Speaker 6:  On the one hand, it gives men a dignified way to name what they have struggled with and to seek help.
Speaker 6:  On the other hand, there is a sense that there is a lack of scientific evidence to support the analogy between sex addiction and any other form of chemical dependency.
Speaker 6:  I think it's a useful concept to use, even if it's a metaphor.
Speaker 6:  Any infidelity is a complex conundrum of personal and cultural and physical factors.
Speaker 6:  And so this couple invites us into the labyrinth of sexual compulsion and its long-term effect on a couple.
Speaker 2:  This is Where Should We Begin?
Speaker 2:  With Esther Perel.
Speaker 3:  I wanted to find some way to make it work, to forgive him, to understand, to just keep our life.
Speaker 3:  You know, we have a very full life.
Speaker 3:  We have children, grandchildren.
Speaker 3:  And I didn't want to throw that away.
Speaker 3:  And through everything that happened, I believe that he didn't do what he did because he wasn't happy in our marriage.
Speaker 3:  He wasn't happy with himself.
Speaker 3:  He had demons.
Speaker 3:  And I'm trying to understand.
Speaker 3:  Do I wholeheartedly believe it?
Speaker 3:  That's another story.
Speaker 6:  And so here is a woman who is able to make an important distinction, which is that she knows this wasn't about her.
Speaker 6:  She knows it wasn't an unhappy relationship.
Speaker 6:  She knows he was unhappy.
Speaker 6:  And from that place, she also chooses to stay with him and to rebuild the relationship.
Speaker 6:  And for her to be able to say that to her children, to her friends, to her community, is a real challenge.
Speaker 3:  The way that it happened for us, we didn't have any kind of formal disclosure.
Speaker 3:  We had eight months of staggered disclosure.
Speaker 3:  I had eight months of staggered disclosure.
Speaker 3:  It was brutal.
Speaker 3:  Telling our kids.
Speaker 3:  Our kids knew everything.
Speaker 6:  Why?
Speaker 7:  When somebody tells me to be honest, I became honest.
Speaker 3:  He wasn't allowed to see our grandchildren.
Speaker 3:  He and my daughter don't even talk today.
Speaker 3:  She's living in another state.
Speaker 8:  And is she mad at you?
Speaker 3:  Yeah, she was very mad at me.
Speaker 8:  For not throwing him out?
Speaker 3:  Well, I did throw him out, but for not ending it.
Speaker 3:  Yes.
Speaker 3:  They thought I was weak.
Speaker 3:  They thought I had Stockholm Syndrome.
Speaker 3:  They felt I, you know, because I've been together, we've been together so long that I never...
Speaker 3:  How many years?
Speaker 3:  I met him when I was 15 and we'll be married 40 come next year.
Speaker 3:  So they just felt that I was too weak in character.
Speaker 3:  And they weren't, they didn't like what they saw.
Speaker 6:  If it was once a stigma when you divorced, today the new shame is choosing to stay when you can leave.
Speaker 6:  And that is the challenge of a lot of betrayed partners.
Speaker 6:  What's wrong with you?
Speaker 6:  Woman, where is your self-esteem?
Speaker 6:  Now that you can go, now that you can divorce, how come you don't?
Speaker 6:  And she's dealing with that new shame.
Speaker 7:  As much pain that it caused my kids to go through this, I'm glad that they know.
Speaker 7:  Glad that they know what I was, what I am now, and that I was man enough to face the demon and do my best to get beyond this.
Speaker 7:  And not let that whole portion of my life define me.
Speaker 7:  And my father, most of my lessons from my dad, I learned what not to do because of what he did.
Speaker 7:  Say more.
Speaker 7:  Well, my father was a very abusive person, physically, mentally, and a philanderer.
Speaker 7:  And I grew up with him being very physical with my mom.
Speaker 7:  So I learned not to do that because I remember the pain that it caused me to see my mom getting beaten up.
Speaker 6:  This is a man who, as a boy, had to absorb a lot of very difficult, scary situations.
Speaker 6:  And most of us don't know how to do so.
Speaker 6:  It's too much.
Speaker 6:  It's too frightening.
Speaker 6:  And we begin to dysregulate.
Speaker 6:  We don't know how to hold all these emotions inside.
Speaker 6:  And this dysregulation will often lead us to seek other means to regulate, to calm ourselves, to deal with our depression.
Speaker 7:  My dad never stepped up and apologized to us.
Speaker 7:  So I taught my kids a lot.
Speaker 7:  You know, I was there for them.
Speaker 7:  They learned a lesson from me how not to be a man from this, how not to treat your wife.
Speaker 7:  It bothers me because I wasted 59 years living a mask.
Speaker 7:  And now if you meet me, you meet me.
Speaker 7:  And it's a wonderful feeling that I don't have to have all these things in my head and what I can say, what I can't say.
Speaker 6:  What happens when the secret dissolves, when the shroudedness is removed?
Speaker 7:  Two things come up that are the hard thing for me to get by is still the shame and the self-pity.
Speaker 7:  I'm not proud of my actions.
Speaker 6:  And the voice of shame says,
Speaker 7:  I can't believe you did this.
Speaker 7:  How did you do these things?
Speaker 7:  You're no good, you know.
Speaker 7:  How could you have just been this human being that was living a dual life?
Speaker 7:  That's the shame.
Speaker 7:  And then the self-pity part, which is even harder for me to get over now, which is I wasted my life.
Speaker 7:  I can't have a 40-year marriage with her.
Speaker 7:  I gave up a lot of things.
Speaker 7:  My kids didn't really know me.
Speaker 7:  I was this other person.
Speaker 7:  As much as I was involved with them, I wasn't present in my life.
Speaker 7:  And I can't get that back.
Speaker 7:  The sadness runs all the time.
Speaker 7:  There's a pain right here that's there all the time.
Speaker 7:  It never goes away.
Speaker 6:  It was there before, too.
Speaker 6:  Never.
Speaker 6:  No, you didn't know it.
Speaker 7:  I didn't know it.
Speaker 6:  You made sure never, never to feel it.
Speaker 7:  Right.
Speaker 7:  Right.
Speaker 7:  But that's there now.
Speaker 7:  And I call that the sadness.
Speaker 7:  And then sometimes that sadness reaches a point where I can't get out of bed.
Speaker 7:  Mm-hmm.
Speaker 6:  And then what do you do?
Speaker 7:  I've got to really fight.
Speaker 7:  One of the things that the 12-step program talks about is the maintenance part of it.
Speaker 7:  It's what you're supposed to do on a daily basis.
Speaker 7:  So one of the first questions I do every day is I ask, what can I do to make your day better?
Speaker 7:  What can I do to make my kids' lives better?
Speaker 6:  This is not a situation where you slug along and you hated your life.
Speaker 6:  And then you find this and then you really wonder, why was I here all these years?
Speaker 6:  Because this is the story of I thought I had a perfect life.
Speaker 6:  We had a very good sexual relation together.
Speaker 6:  And I find out that my husband has been having a sexual problem for the entire duration of his life.
Speaker 6:  Does that invalidate everything you felt?
Speaker 6:  Does that invalidate every trip you took, every dinner you had, every celebration?
Speaker 6:  Or does it say, this is the most bizarre thing, but there were two realities living side by side,
Speaker 6:  one of which you actually have nothing to do with.
Speaker 6:  It has nothing to do with your marriage.
Speaker 6:  How does one element like this, however huge, does it change the entire history?
Speaker 6:  Does it change everything you believed in?
Speaker 6:  Or does it have to find its place because everything you believed in was,
Speaker 6:  and yet there was a whole other reality?
Speaker 6:  That's something to consider.
Speaker 6:  That and that versus that instead of that.
Speaker 3:  I didn't believe that at first because I ripped up every wedding picture I had.
Speaker 3:  Any picture that I found that was of he and I during that time was torn to shreds.
Speaker 3:  Anything.
Speaker 3:  My wedding dress.
Speaker 3:  I had our wedding vows on tape.
Speaker 3:  Cut that to shreds.
Speaker 3:  Because that wasn't real.
Speaker 3:  You don't stand up in front of all these people, make these vows to me,
Speaker 3:  and then a month later, break them?
Speaker 3:  It wasn't real.
Speaker 6:  We all understand that the future is unpredictable.
Speaker 6:  But we expect that our past will be dependable,
Speaker 6:  and that we can look back and trust what we experienced.
Speaker 6:  And when you are betrayed by your partner,
Speaker 6:  you lose the coherence of the narrative of your life.
Speaker 6:  And maybe the essence of the betrayal is when we rob somebody of the story of their life.
Speaker 3:  So, yeah, that part of it takes away from what I thought I had.
Speaker 3:  I mean, he was a good husband.
Speaker 3:  He was always home.
Speaker 3:  He was always, he was the best father ever.
Speaker 3:  Always there with our children.
Speaker 3:  Always loving to me.
Speaker 3:  I never knew anything was wrong.
Speaker 3:  And I don't want to say I'm one of those women who lived in, you know,
Speaker 3:  a tunnel without any peripheral vision.
Speaker 3:  I'd, you know, if something came up, I'd question him,
Speaker 3:  and he'd tell me the story, and I'd believe him.
Speaker 3:  Why not believe him?
Speaker 3:  He's never done anything to cause me to mistrust him.
Speaker 3:  Now I look at him, and if he tells me this pen is red,
Speaker 3:  I will turn it 15 different ways today.
Speaker 3:  And that's a huge issue for us now.
Speaker 3:  So, yeah, I mean, we had a good marriage,
Speaker 3:  and that's why I'm still here.
Speaker 3:  And I don't doubt for one second that he didn't love me with all of his heart.
Speaker 3:  Not for one second.
Speaker 6:  Do you hear that?
Speaker 6:  Um, I'm here.
Speaker 6:  Which means that when you're taking your piece of shit,
Speaker 6:  you have to know that your wife has this incredible ability
Speaker 6:  to see that what you did was really hurtful,
Speaker 6:  and at the same time that you did it because you were hurting.
Speaker 7:  I don't think she gets all of that 100% yet.
Speaker 7:  She's coming around to it,
Speaker 7:  and very lately she's been coming around to it.
Speaker 7:  I would say within the last four to six weeks,
Speaker 7:  she's finally starting to see my side of the story.
Speaker 7:  She's been so...
Speaker 7:  And it's a wonderful feeling.
Speaker 7:  It makes me want to cry
Speaker 7:  because it just validates what I'm doing and what I am.
Speaker 7:  Her pain has been just so overwhelming
Speaker 7:  that whatever I was going through didn't matter.
Speaker 7:  It had a...
Speaker 7:  She needed to figure out her side
Speaker 7:  before she could even start to think about
Speaker 7:  why I was doing what I was doing.
Speaker 7:  There was just so much anger, hatred towards me.
Speaker 6:  And on a complete rollercoaster?
Speaker 7:  Rollercoaster is being gentle.
Speaker 6:  Disgust.
Speaker 3:  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 3:  Attraction.
Speaker 3:  I still hate him for what he did to me.
Speaker 3:  I hate him for it.
Speaker 3:  I...
Speaker 3:  You know, I can't come to terms with accepting it.
Speaker 3:  You know, whatever the reasons were,
Speaker 3:  he still cheated on me
Speaker 3:  for a very, very, very, very long time.
Speaker 3:  And when he first got caught
Speaker 3:  a number of years ago, 15 years ago,
Speaker 3:  and swore to me it was a one-time thing,
Speaker 3:  and looked at me in the face
Speaker 3:  and held my hand and said,
Speaker 3:  Oh, my God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
Speaker 3:  I will never do that to you.
Speaker 3:  I will never cause you that kind of pain again.
Speaker 3:  And only, you know, 12 years later
Speaker 3:  to be caused
Speaker 3:  undescribable pain.
Speaker 3:  Worse than anything I could ever have imagined.
Speaker 3:  I'm now supposed to trust him
Speaker 3:  that he's never going to do that again?
Speaker 6:  The question of trust
Speaker 6:  that he will never do this again
Speaker 6:  is completely premature.
Speaker 6:  Okay.
Speaker 6:  Tell that to him.
Speaker 3:  Tell that to him,
Speaker 3:  because that's a huge issue.
Speaker 6:  My answer to this woman in this moment
Speaker 6:  should have been,
Speaker 6:  it is unacceptable.
Speaker 6:  It feels too big to accept.
Speaker 6:  When you have a new element
Speaker 6:  that enters into the narrative of your life,
Speaker 6:  you start to wonder,
Speaker 6:  does it color everything?
Speaker 6:  Does it redefine the entire story?
Speaker 6:  Does it make everything else fraudulent?
Speaker 6:  Or do you actually hold on to it
Speaker 6:  and you say,
Speaker 6:  what was was real,
Speaker 6:  and then there was this other piece
Speaker 6:  living in the shadow
Speaker 6:  that was also real.
Speaker 6:  And how you integrate
Speaker 6:  those pieces of the reality
Speaker 6:  and come back to creating
Speaker 6:  a coherent whole
Speaker 6:  is an essential part of the process
Speaker 6:  at this moment for this couple.
Speaker 6:  The point of if you do this again or not
Speaker 6:  is central,
Speaker 6:  but there are so many more things
Speaker 6:  to understand here.
Speaker 6:  Okay.
Speaker 6:  I mean,
Speaker 6:  you're not just trusting
Speaker 6:  that he's not doing,
Speaker 6:  this again.
Speaker 6:  You want to trust the human being.
Speaker 6:  Right.
Speaker 6:  And that comes from him being able,
Speaker 6:  as he learns about himself
Speaker 6:  and as he connects
Speaker 6:  with his own trauma story.
Speaker 6:  Because that ultimately
Speaker 6:  is at the core
Speaker 6:  of everything he's been doing.
Speaker 6:  I mean,
Speaker 6:  I don't have to tell you,
Speaker 6:  but I'm sure in your 12-step meetings,
Speaker 6:  there are a lot of men
Speaker 6:  who were beaten
Speaker 6:  by their dads.
Speaker 6:  Yes.
Speaker 6:  And a lot of men
Speaker 6:  watching their dad
Speaker 6:  beat their mother,
Speaker 6:  wanting to save the mother,
Speaker 6:  not being able
Speaker 6:  to protect the mother,
Speaker 6:  and then disconnecting
Speaker 6:  and being able
Speaker 6:  to only relate to women
Speaker 6:  as long as they were
Speaker 6:  as anonymous
Speaker 6:  and as objectified
Speaker 6:  and as commodified
Speaker 6:  as can be
Speaker 6:  so that you don't have
Speaker 6:  to worry about them.
Speaker 6:  Did that make sense
Speaker 6:  what I just said?
Speaker 6:  Yes.
Speaker 9:  Yes, it does.
Speaker 6:  And while at the same time
Speaker 6:  being super responsible
Speaker 6:  and fatherly
Speaker 6:  and a good husband at home.
Speaker 6:  This man pays
Speaker 6:  to play,
Speaker 6:  as he calls it.
Speaker 6:  And I would probably say
Speaker 6:  that he pays
Speaker 6:  to heal.
Speaker 6:  He pays
Speaker 6:  to take care of his pain.
Speaker 6:  He pays
Speaker 6:  so that he can
Speaker 6:  acquit himself
Speaker 6:  of any emotional debt.
Speaker 6:  If it's casual,
Speaker 6:  if it's transactional,
Speaker 6:  if it's recreational,
Speaker 6:  if it's anonymous,
Speaker 6:  it frees him
Speaker 6:  from the emotional
Speaker 6:  responsibility
Speaker 6:  that he feels
Speaker 6:  towards the women
Speaker 6:  that he loves
Speaker 6:  and cares about.
Speaker 6:  It gives him
Speaker 6:  a certain room
Speaker 6:  for simplicity
Speaker 6:  and selfishness.
Speaker 6:  To me,
Speaker 6:  a lot of the honesty
Speaker 6:  is about that.
Speaker 6:  It goes beyond
Speaker 6:  the sordid details
Speaker 6:  of your sexual
Speaker 6:  outmanoeuvring.
Speaker 6:  You know,
Speaker 6:  the story
Speaker 6:  is not a story
Speaker 6:  of sex.
Speaker 7:  I've tried to explain
Speaker 7:  that to him
Speaker 6:  many times.
Speaker 6:  Yes, but for that
Speaker 6:  you need to bring
Speaker 6:  in the other content.
Speaker 6:  Because what is
Speaker 6:  so difficult
Speaker 6:  for any partner
Speaker 6:  is the level
Speaker 6:  of compartmentalization.
Speaker 6:  You have lived
Speaker 6:  with it.
Speaker 6:  It's kind of
Speaker 6:  a second skin.
Speaker 6:  For the person
Speaker 6:  on the other side,
Speaker 6:  it is something
Speaker 6:  inconceivable.
Speaker 6:  And so then
Speaker 6:  you wonder,
Speaker 6:  who was I with?
Speaker 6:  Not is what
Speaker 6:  we experienced
Speaker 6:  real,
Speaker 6:  but who was I with?
Speaker 6:  Who's the guy?
Speaker 6:  And the guy
Speaker 6:  was both.
Speaker 6:  He was both.
Speaker 6:  And now
Speaker 6:  he's working
Speaker 6:  on one thing
Speaker 6:  and that is
Speaker 6:  to find some way
Speaker 6:  to integrate
Speaker 6:  his good self
Speaker 6:  and his bad self.
Speaker 6:  And these two
Speaker 6:  have,
Speaker 6:  most of the time
Speaker 6:  lived very,
Speaker 6:  very,
Speaker 6:  very separate.
Speaker 6:  Mm-hmm.
Speaker 6:  In you.
Speaker 6:  Yeah.
Speaker 6:  No more.
Speaker 7:  And there's nothing
Speaker 7:  I could think of
Speaker 7:  that would ever
Speaker 7:  want me to go back
Speaker 7:  to that place.
Speaker 6:  I get it.
Speaker 6:  But when you talk
Speaker 6:  about being honest,
Speaker 6:  this is a different
Speaker 6:  story of honesty.
Speaker 7:  For all of our
Speaker 7:  adult life,
Speaker 7:  she never knew
Speaker 7:  about my sexual
Speaker 7:  molestation.
Speaker 7:  She didn't know
Speaker 7:  about it until I was,
Speaker 7:  as a matter of fact,
Speaker 7:  nobody knew about it
Speaker 7:  until I was 59 years old.
Speaker 7:  And I took some sort
Speaker 7:  of responsibility
Speaker 7:  for that
Speaker 7:  because I didn't say no
Speaker 7:  and I didn't fight.
Speaker 7:  And it happened
Speaker 7:  on more than one occasion.
Speaker 6:  With?
Speaker 7:  An older male.
Speaker 7:  And
Speaker 7:  I just
Speaker 7:  put it in a place
Speaker 7:  and it just,
Speaker 7:  and I went on.
Speaker 6:  I think what's important
Speaker 6:  in what he describes
Speaker 6:  is that
Speaker 6:  he
Speaker 6:  tells us
Speaker 6:  about
Speaker 6:  an experience
Speaker 6:  that many,
Speaker 6:  many boys
Speaker 6:  have.
Speaker 6:  They live
Speaker 6:  with tremendous
Speaker 6:  shame
Speaker 6:  and tremendous
Speaker 6:  sense that
Speaker 6:  they're damaged
Speaker 6:  and tremendous
Speaker 6:  sense that maybe
Speaker 6:  they could have
Speaker 6:  prevented this
Speaker 6:  or maybe that
Speaker 6:  that's what
Speaker 6:  they deserve.
Speaker 6:  It internalizes
Speaker 6:  a sense of
Speaker 6:  dirty,
Speaker 6:  bad,
Speaker 6:  and that begins
Speaker 6:  to be the split
Speaker 6:  between the good me
Speaker 6:  and the bad me.
Speaker 6:  I could have an entire
Speaker 6:  individual session
Speaker 6:  with him
Speaker 6:  about his past,
Speaker 6:  about how
Speaker 6:  the split
Speaker 6:  emerged
Speaker 6:  and then was
Speaker 6:  fostered
Speaker 6:  and so forth.
Speaker 6:  But I also know
Speaker 6:  that they came
Speaker 6:  as a couple
Speaker 6:  and part
Speaker 6:  of what needs
Speaker 6:  to happen
Speaker 6:  with him
Speaker 6:  so that
Speaker 6:  they can really
Speaker 6:  begin to mend
Speaker 6:  is for him
Speaker 6:  to step out
Speaker 6:  of himself
Speaker 6:  and to be able
Speaker 6:  to reach out
Speaker 6:  to her.
Speaker 6:  How much,
Speaker 6:  how much does he
Speaker 6:  talk about
Speaker 6:  what he did
Speaker 6:  to you
Speaker 6:  versus what
Speaker 6:  happened to him?
Speaker 6:  I would say
Speaker 6:  he talks more
Speaker 6:  about what
Speaker 6:  happened to him
Speaker 6:  than what happened
Speaker 6:  to me.
Speaker 6:  I'm sensing that.
Speaker 6:  that is
Speaker 6:  off balance.
Speaker 6:  Okay.
Speaker 6:  So listen to her
Speaker 6:  very carefully
Speaker 6:  because I think
Speaker 6:  she may have
Speaker 6:  tried to say
Speaker 6:  this already
Speaker 6:  more than once.
Speaker 3:  I really feel
Speaker 3:  that you talk
Speaker 3:  more about you
Speaker 3:  and the pain
Speaker 3:  you're going through
Speaker 3:  than the horrific
Speaker 3:  pain you caused
Speaker 3:  me.
Speaker 3:  All of your pain
Speaker 3:  was self-inflicted.
Speaker 3:  You made choices.
Speaker 3:  You made decisions.
Speaker 3:  You put yourself
Speaker 3:  out there.
Speaker 3:  But everything
Speaker 3:  that was done
Speaker 3:  to me
Speaker 3:  is not something
Speaker 3:  I asked for
Speaker 3:  and not something
Speaker 3:  I wanted to be
Speaker 3:  party to.
Speaker 3:  I mean,
Speaker 3:  I know you know
Speaker 3:  you hurt me,
Speaker 3:  but I don't think
Speaker 3:  you really get
Speaker 3:  the magnitude
Speaker 3:  because it always
Speaker 3:  switches back
Speaker 3:  to you.
Speaker 7:  But the point
Speaker 7:  of the whole story
Speaker 7:  is...
Speaker 6:  Before you butt,
Speaker 6:  can you just tell her
Speaker 6:  what you just heard
Speaker 6:  so that we know
Speaker 6:  that it reached you?
Speaker 7:  That I'm not
Speaker 7:  compassionate
Speaker 7:  to your trauma
Speaker 7:  and I talk more
Speaker 7:  about my own trauma
Speaker 7:  than your trauma.
Speaker 7:  Is that...
Speaker 7:  Pretty well sum it up.
Speaker 7:  Talking about it,
Speaker 7:  it just brings us
Speaker 7:  both to such
Speaker 7:  a bad place
Speaker 7:  and all it does
Speaker 7:  is bring out
Speaker 7:  anger
Speaker 7:  and hate from you
Speaker 7:  every time I try
Speaker 7:  to talk about this
Speaker 6:  with you.
Speaker 6:  So, let me
Speaker 6:  try to help you
Speaker 6:  do this in a way
Speaker 6:  that is more healing
Speaker 6:  and less activating
Speaker 6:  because you're
Speaker 6:  in a certain phase.
Speaker 6:  You've gone
Speaker 6:  from the
Speaker 6:  59 years
Speaker 6:  of trying
Speaker 6:  to deny everything,
Speaker 6:  numb myself,
Speaker 6:  feel nothing,
Speaker 6:  medicate,
Speaker 6:  and now
Speaker 6:  I'm in touch.
Speaker 6:  I'm in touch
Speaker 6:  with myself.
Speaker 6:  I'm figuring it out.
Speaker 6:  I'm putting
Speaker 6:  the pieces together
Speaker 6:  and it's making sense
Speaker 6:  for the first time.
Speaker 6:  There is no mask
Speaker 6:  in front of me
Speaker 6:  and I am
Speaker 6:  so deep
Speaker 6:  into myself.
Speaker 6:  I'm so
Speaker 6:  freaking self-absorbed.
Speaker 6:  It's still
Speaker 6:  more about me.
Speaker 6:  It was about me
Speaker 6:  then
Speaker 6:  and it is
Speaker 6:  about me
Speaker 6:  now.
Speaker 6:  And now
Speaker 6:  you've got to
Speaker 6:  step out of yourself
Speaker 6:  for a moment
Speaker 6:  because it's
Speaker 6:  always both.
Speaker 6:  It's what it
Speaker 6:  meant to you
Speaker 6:  and what it
Speaker 6:  did to her.
Speaker 6:  If you
Speaker 6:  attend to
Speaker 6:  her
Speaker 6:  primary concern,
Speaker 6:  then she
Speaker 6:  can attend
Speaker 6:  to your
Speaker 6:  primary
Speaker 6:  trajectory.
Speaker 6:  But she
Speaker 6:  can only
Speaker 6:  do that
Speaker 6:  if there
Speaker 6:  is space
Speaker 6:  inside of her
Speaker 6:  and that
Speaker 6:  space
Speaker 6:  is created
Speaker 6:  because you
Speaker 6:  are saying
Speaker 6:  to her,
Speaker 6:  how are you
Speaker 6:  doing?
Speaker 6:  How much
Speaker 6:  have you been
Speaker 6:  thinking about
Speaker 6:  this today?
Speaker 6:  I cannot
Speaker 6:  believe what
Speaker 6:  I cannot
Speaker 6:  believe what
Speaker 6:  I mean.
Speaker 6:  And that
Speaker 6:  I cannot
Speaker 6:  believe
Speaker 6:  from a place
Speaker 6:  of responsibility
Speaker 6:  not from
Speaker 6:  a place
Speaker 6:  of shame.
Speaker 7:  I take
Speaker 7:  responsibility.
Speaker 7:  Yeah?
Speaker 7:  Be very
Speaker 7:  clear.
Speaker 7:  I take
Speaker 7:  100%.
Speaker 7:  There is
Speaker 7:  no excuse.
Speaker 7:  There are
Speaker 7:  a couple
Speaker 7:  of reasons.
Speaker 6:  But the
Speaker 6:  problem is
Speaker 6:  that if
Speaker 6:  you go
Speaker 6:  to her
Speaker 6:  and you
Speaker 6:  say to
Speaker 6:  her,
Speaker 6:  I can't
Speaker 6:  believe how
Speaker 6:  I treated
Speaker 6:  you,
Speaker 6:  you have
Speaker 6:  to be
Speaker 6:  able to
Speaker 6:  not say,
Speaker 6:  I feel
Speaker 6:  so bad
Speaker 6:  about me
Speaker 6:  for having
Speaker 6:  done this.
Speaker 6:  It's the
Speaker 6:  difference
Speaker 6:  between I
Speaker 6:  feel so bad
Speaker 6:  about myself
Speaker 6:  versus I
Speaker 6:  feel bad
Speaker 6:  for you.
Speaker 7:  That makes
Speaker 7:  a lot of
Speaker 7:  sense.
Speaker 10:  And what
Speaker 10:  she needs
Speaker 10:  is for
Speaker 10:  you to
Speaker 10:  finally
Speaker 10:  step out
Speaker 10:  of yourself
Speaker 10:  and actually
Speaker 6:  be able
Speaker 6:  to say,
Speaker 6:  I feel
Speaker 6:  so bad
Speaker 6:  for you.
Speaker 18:  I didn't
Speaker 18:  do it
Speaker 3:  to you.
Speaker 3:  I didn't
Speaker 3:  cause you
Speaker 3:  all of this
Speaker 3:  pain in your
Speaker 3:  life,
Speaker 3:  but you
Speaker 3:  caused me
Speaker 3:  all this
Speaker 3:  pain in
Speaker 3:  my life.
Speaker 3:  You have
Speaker 3:  to find
Speaker 3:  a way
Speaker 3:  to help
Speaker 3:  me through
Speaker 3:  it.
Speaker 7:  I came
Speaker 7:  to you
Speaker 7:  last night.
Speaker 7:  I hug
Speaker 7:  you.
Speaker 7:  And you
Speaker 7:  have to
Speaker 6:  let me
Speaker 6:  say that.
Speaker 6:  But people,
Speaker 6:  you're going
Speaker 6:  to help
Speaker 6:  each other
Speaker 6:  help each
Speaker 6:  other.
Speaker 6:  You're going
Speaker 6:  to learn
Speaker 6:  that together.
Speaker 6:  So when
Speaker 6:  you get
Speaker 6:  all upset
Speaker 6:  that he
Speaker 6:  has to,
Speaker 6:  he has
Speaker 6:  to,
Speaker 6:  he doesn't
Speaker 6:  know.
Speaker 6:  He doesn't
Speaker 6:  disagree,
Speaker 6:  but he
Speaker 6:  doesn't
Speaker 6:  know.
Speaker 6:  So you
Speaker 6:  tell him
Speaker 6:  what you
Speaker 6:  want.
Speaker 6:  Don't tell
Speaker 6:  him what
Speaker 6:  he has
Speaker 6:  to or
Speaker 6:  what he
Speaker 6:  does
Speaker 6:  wrong.
Speaker 11:  It's
Speaker 11:  good
Speaker 11:  that
Speaker 11:  all the
Speaker 11:  time.
Speaker 11:  Tell
Speaker 11:  me
Speaker 11:  what
Speaker 11:  you
Speaker 11:  want.
Speaker 11:  I'm
Speaker 11:  there.
Speaker 11:  I am
Speaker 7:  all in.
Speaker 7:  I am
Speaker 7:  100%
Speaker 7:  all in.
Speaker 6:  I believe
Speaker 6:  you.
Speaker 7:  I am
Speaker 7:  self-absorbed.
Speaker 7:  I got to
Speaker 7:  get out
Speaker 7:  of that.
Speaker 6:  Do you
Speaker 6:  understand the
Speaker 6:  difference?
Speaker 6:  Yes.
Speaker 7:  Not until
Speaker 7:  10 minutes
Speaker 7:  ago.
Speaker 6:  So I
Speaker 6:  would
Speaker 7:  make your
Speaker 7:  day
Speaker 7:  better.
Speaker 7:  It's
Speaker 7:  putting
Speaker 7:  her
Speaker 7:  before
Speaker 7:  my own
Speaker 7:  self
Speaker 7:  and needs.
Speaker 7:  And I
Speaker 7:  demonstrate
Speaker 7:  this
Speaker 7:  every day.
Speaker 7:  And it's
Speaker 7:  important for
Speaker 7:  me.
Speaker 6:  It's
Speaker 6:  beautiful.
Speaker 6:  But your
Speaker 6:  wife
Speaker 6:  is more
Speaker 6:  isolated
Speaker 6:  than you.
Speaker 9:  Okay.
Speaker 6:  And she
Speaker 6:  needs
Speaker 6:  not an
Speaker 6:  apology.
Speaker 6:  She needs
Speaker 6:  an acknowledgement
Speaker 6:  of her
Speaker 6:  experience.
Speaker 6:  Yep.
Speaker 6:  It's just
Speaker 6:  that.
Speaker 6:  You can
Speaker 6:  use the
Speaker 6:  words you
Speaker 6:  want.
Speaker 6:  You can
Speaker 6:  use your
Speaker 6:  body.
Speaker 6:  When he
Speaker 6:  speaks,
Speaker 6:  he wants
Speaker 6:  to be there
Speaker 6:  for her.
Speaker 6:  But it's
Speaker 6:  more about
Speaker 6:  him.
Speaker 6:  When his
Speaker 6:  body speaks,
Speaker 6:  he's actually
Speaker 6:  there for
Speaker 6:  her.
Speaker 6:  and the
Speaker 6:  moment he
Speaker 6:  holds her,
Speaker 6:  both of
Speaker 6:  them start
Speaker 6:  sobbing.
Speaker 6:  And they
Speaker 6:  have crossed
Speaker 6:  the bridge
Speaker 6:  to each
Speaker 6:  other.
Speaker 12:  I can't
Speaker 12:  imagine what
Speaker 12:  you're going
Speaker 12:  through.
Speaker 12:  But I'm
Speaker 12:  here for
Speaker 12:  you.
Speaker 6:  And it's
Speaker 6:  good.
Speaker 6:  Do you
Speaker 6:  understand the
Speaker 6:  difference?
Speaker 6:  Yes,
Speaker 6:  I do.
Speaker 6:  she needs
Speaker 6:  an occasion
Speaker 6:  for you
Speaker 6:  to leave
Speaker 6:  your belly
Speaker 6:  button
Speaker 6:  and reach
Speaker 6:  out to
Speaker 6:  her
Speaker 6:  and feel
Speaker 6:  bad for
Speaker 6:  her and
Speaker 6:  not so
Speaker 6:  bad just
Speaker 6:  for yourself.
Speaker 6:  Otherwise,
Speaker 6:  she's left
Speaker 6:  all alone
Speaker 6:  to try to
Speaker 6:  justify
Speaker 6:  what's wrong
Speaker 6:  with me
Speaker 6:  that I
Speaker 6:  am here
Speaker 6:  accepting
Speaker 6:  this.
Speaker 6:  Where's
Speaker 6:  my self
Speaker 6:  esteem?
Speaker 13:  something like
Speaker 13:  that?
Speaker 13:  That's
Speaker 13:  exactly it.
Speaker 13:  Yeah,
Speaker 13:  that's it.
Speaker 13:  That's it.
Speaker 6:  And she's
Speaker 6:  dealing with
Speaker 6:  that new
Speaker 6:  shame of
Speaker 6:  where's your
Speaker 6:  self-respect?
Speaker 6:  What kind
Speaker 6:  of woman
Speaker 6:  would let
Speaker 6:  herself,
Speaker 6:  you know,
Speaker 6:  particularly
Speaker 6:  even her
Speaker 6:  best friends
Speaker 6:  may be
Speaker 6:  questioning
Speaker 6:  her?
Speaker 6:  and that
Speaker 6:  barrage
Speaker 6:  she has
Speaker 6:  to confront
Speaker 6:  and often
Speaker 6:  alone
Speaker 6:  because he
Speaker 6:  has a
Speaker 6:  community.
Speaker 6:  He has
Speaker 6:  the 12-step
Speaker 6:  support groups
Speaker 6:  and he has
Speaker 6:  an entire
Speaker 6:  new family
Speaker 6:  with whom
Speaker 6:  he can discuss
Speaker 6:  all the issues
Speaker 6:  that he's
Speaker 6:  grappling with
Speaker 6:  whereas she's
Speaker 6:  often quite
Speaker 6:  alone.
Speaker 6:  part of
Speaker 6:  why he
Speaker 6:  can't
Speaker 6:  see what
Speaker 6:  you're
Speaker 6:  going
Speaker 6:  through
Speaker 6:  is because
Speaker 6:  he's
Speaker 6:  responsible
Speaker 6:  for much
Speaker 6:  of it
Speaker 6:  and
Speaker 6:  he can't
Speaker 6:  look at
Speaker 6:  himself.
Speaker 6:  It's not
Speaker 6:  happening for
Speaker 6:  no reason
Speaker 6:  and it's not
Speaker 6:  happening out
Speaker 6:  of callousness.
Speaker 6:  It's very
Speaker 6:  hard to
Speaker 6:  stay in the
Speaker 6:  position of
Speaker 6:  responsibility
Speaker 6:  and guilt
Speaker 6:  versus shame.
Speaker 15:  Very hard.
Speaker 6:  Okay?
Speaker 6:  But this is
Speaker 6:  your practice.
Speaker 6:  Your relationship
Speaker 6:  practice
Speaker 6:  is to be able
Speaker 6:  to feel
Speaker 6:  more guilt
Speaker 6:  because guilt
Speaker 6:  is the
Speaker 6:  responsibility
Speaker 6:  towards another
Speaker 6:  person.
Speaker 6:  But then
Speaker 6:  when he
Speaker 6:  crosses
Speaker 6:  you need
Speaker 6:  to also
Speaker 6:  be able
Speaker 6:  to hear it
Speaker 6:  and not
Speaker 6:  say
Speaker 6:  I need
Speaker 6:  you to
Speaker 6:  or you
Speaker 6:  have to
Speaker 6:  when he's
Speaker 6:  actually in
Speaker 6:  the midst
Speaker 6:  of doing
Speaker 6:  it.
Speaker 7:  That's
Speaker 7:  probably
Speaker 7:  our biggest
Speaker 7:  problem
Speaker 7:  because
Speaker 7:  every time
Speaker 7:  not every
Speaker 7:  time
Speaker 7:  a majority
Speaker 7:  of the time
Speaker 7:  when I do
Speaker 7:  cross over
Speaker 7:  instead of
Speaker 7:  getting a pat
Speaker 7:  on the back
Speaker 7:  I get slapped
Speaker 7:  in the face
Speaker 7:  so I don't
Speaker 7:  cross over.
Speaker 6:  Right.
Speaker 6:  But I want
Speaker 6:  you to know
Speaker 6:  this is a bit
Speaker 6:  of a beast
Speaker 6:  for many people
Speaker 6:  in your situation.
Speaker 6:  It is one
Speaker 6:  of the most
Speaker 6:  difficult
Speaker 6:  challenges
Speaker 6:  because I don't
Speaker 6:  think she means
Speaker 6:  to slap you.
Speaker 6:  I don't think
Speaker 6:  that that's her
Speaker 6:  intention at all.
Speaker 6:  What she's
Speaker 6:  trying to say
Speaker 6:  is why
Speaker 6:  am I not
Speaker 6:  feeling any
Speaker 6:  better even
Speaker 6:  though you're
Speaker 6:  supposedly doing
Speaker 6:  what I say
Speaker 6:  I want you
Speaker 6:  to do.
Speaker 6:  That's
Speaker 6:  spot on.
Speaker 6:  And that is
Speaker 6:  true and
Speaker 6:  normal.
Speaker 6:  I understand
Speaker 6:  they don't
Speaker 6:  apologize
Speaker 6:  but apologizing
Speaker 6:  is different
Speaker 6:  from acknowledging
Speaker 6:  the other
Speaker 6:  person's
Speaker 6:  experience.
Speaker 6:  Yeah.
Speaker 6:  Yeah.
Speaker 6:  How have you
Speaker 6:  come to understand
Speaker 6:  what has
Speaker 6:  happened to him
Speaker 6:  all these years?
Speaker 3:  by reading
Speaker 3:  about it
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  being educated
Speaker 3:  that men
Speaker 3:  women
Speaker 3:  do this
Speaker 3:  because
Speaker 3:  of their
Speaker 3:  need to
Speaker 3:  soothe
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  had
Speaker 3:  he
Speaker 3:  ever
Speaker 3:  disclosed
Speaker 3:  that any
Speaker 3:  one of the
Speaker 3:  people that
Speaker 3:  he was with
Speaker 3:  there was
Speaker 3:  more than
Speaker 3:  just sex
Speaker 3:  I probably
Speaker 3:  wouldn't be
Speaker 3:  here today
Speaker 3:  but there
Speaker 3:  was nobody
Speaker 3:  that
Speaker 3:  was more
Speaker 3:  than
Speaker 3:  just
Speaker 3:  casual
Speaker 3:  sex
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  that
Speaker 3:  feels
Speaker 3:  better.
Speaker 6:  In what
Speaker 6:  way?
Speaker 6:  For you?
Speaker 3:  because of
Speaker 3:  me
Speaker 3:  he just
Speaker 3:  he loved
Speaker 3:  me
Speaker 3:  you know
Speaker 3:  and then
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  I question
Speaker 3:  how could you
Speaker 3:  have really
Speaker 3:  loved me
Speaker 3:  if you did
Speaker 3:  that to me?
Speaker 3:  You know
Speaker 3:  fidelity
Speaker 3:  between
Speaker 3:  a couple
Speaker 3:  is sacred
Speaker 3:  it's
Speaker 3:  it's
Speaker 3:  it's
Speaker 3:  sacred
Speaker 3:  I wish
Speaker 3:  he would
Speaker 3:  have been
Speaker 3:  a gambler
Speaker 3:  a drug
Speaker 3:  addict
Speaker 3:  anything
Speaker 3:  but sex
Speaker 3:  just
Speaker 3:  something
Speaker 3:  that
Speaker 3:  I thought
Speaker 3:  was ours
Speaker 3:  to be
Speaker 3:  you know
Speaker 3:  told that
Speaker 3:  it wasn't
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  for
Speaker 3:  the amount
Speaker 3:  of
Speaker 3:  people
Speaker 3:  and years
Speaker 3:  you know
Speaker 3:  when we
Speaker 3:  calculate
Speaker 3:  in my
Speaker 3:  head
Speaker 3:  exactly
Speaker 3:  how many
Speaker 3:  years
Speaker 3:  it was
Speaker 3:  22 years
Speaker 3:  22 years
Speaker 3:  we're married
Speaker 3:  36
Speaker 3:  you take
Speaker 3:  away the
Speaker 3:  2
Speaker 3:  you take
Speaker 3:  away the
Speaker 3:  12
Speaker 3:  you cheated
Speaker 3:  on me
Speaker 3:  for 22
Speaker 14:  years
Speaker 14:  it's
Speaker 14:  mind-bongling
Speaker 16:  I didn't
Speaker 16:  cheat on
Speaker 16:  it for
Speaker 16:  12 years
Speaker 6:  it's
Speaker 6:  just
Speaker 6:  your wife
Speaker 6:  has just
Speaker 6:  said
Speaker 6:  so many
Speaker 6:  important
Speaker 6:  things
Speaker 6:  and the
Speaker 6:  only thing
Speaker 6:  you respond
Speaker 6:  to is
Speaker 6:  the
Speaker 6:  calculus
Speaker 15:  we go
Speaker 15:  through this
Speaker 15:  all the
Speaker 15:  time
Speaker 15:  is the
Speaker 15:  calculus
Speaker 6:  you know
Speaker 6:  you have
Speaker 6:  to respond
Speaker 6:  differently
Speaker 6:  than what
Speaker 6:  you just
Speaker 6:  did
Speaker 6:  you can
Speaker 6:  do better
Speaker 6:  yeah
Speaker 6:  yeah
Speaker 16:  it was a
Speaker 16:  horrible
Speaker 16:  thing
Speaker 16:  that
Speaker 16:  you had
Speaker 16:  to go
Speaker 16:  through
Speaker 16:  that
Speaker 7:  you're
Speaker 7:  my
Speaker 7:  family
Speaker 7:  and it's
Speaker 7:  crazy
Speaker 7:  as it
Speaker 7:  sounds
Speaker 7:  how can
Speaker 7:  I do
Speaker 7:  this
Speaker 7:  to my
Speaker 7:  family
Speaker 7:  and I
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  have the
Speaker 7:  answers
Speaker 7:  and I
Speaker 7:  know
Speaker 7:  why
Speaker 7:  and I
Speaker 7:  know
Speaker 7:  why
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  don't
Speaker 7:  want to
Speaker 7:  ever have
Speaker 7:  to go
Speaker 7:  there
Speaker 7:  again
Speaker 3:  and that's
Speaker 3:  the part
Speaker 3:  that scares
Speaker 3:  me
Speaker 3:  you know
Speaker 3:  once an
Speaker 3:  addict
Speaker 3:  always an
Speaker 3:  addict
Speaker 3:  is
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  don't
Speaker 9:  know
Speaker 7:  I sit
Speaker 7:  in rooms
Speaker 7:  with a lot
Speaker 7:  of guys
Speaker 7:  that have
Speaker 7:  what they
Speaker 7:  call slips
Speaker 7:  and I
Speaker 7:  can't
Speaker 7:  understand
Speaker 7:  how anybody
Speaker 7:  could slip
Speaker 7:  once you
Speaker 7:  get it
Speaker 7:  once you
Speaker 7:  understand
Speaker 7:  that
Speaker 7:  it's not
Speaker 7:  real
Speaker 7:  it's just
Speaker 7:  going to
Speaker 7:  add to
Speaker 7:  shame
Speaker 7:  it's just
Speaker 7:  going to
Speaker 7:  add to
Speaker 7:  depression
Speaker 7:  it's not
Speaker 7:  going to
Speaker 17:  again I'm
Speaker 17:  not worried
Speaker 17:  about
Speaker 17:  what it's
Speaker 17:  going to
Speaker 17:  do to
Speaker 17:  you
Speaker 17:  I'm
Speaker 17:  worried
Speaker 17:  about
Speaker 17:  what it's
Speaker 17:  going to
Speaker 17:  do to
Speaker 17:  me
Speaker 7:  you're
Speaker 7:  asking
Speaker 7:  me
Speaker 7:  what
Speaker 7:  could
Speaker 7:  drive
Speaker 7:  me
Speaker 7:  off
Speaker 7:  the
Speaker 7:  road
Speaker 7:  and I'm
Speaker 7:  trying
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  tell
Speaker 7:  you
Speaker 7:  you
Speaker 6:  know
Speaker 6:  what
Speaker 6:  may
Speaker 6:  be
Speaker 6:  more
Speaker 6:  helpful
Speaker 6:  don't
Speaker 6:  try
Speaker 6:  to
Speaker 6:  convince
Speaker 6:  her
Speaker 6:  okay
Speaker 6:  because
Speaker 6:  you
Speaker 6:  can't
Speaker 6:  be
Speaker 6:  that
Speaker 6:  certain
Speaker 6:  either
Speaker 6:  I
Speaker 6:  would
Speaker 6:  suggest
Speaker 6:  that
Speaker 6:  you
Speaker 6:  simply
Speaker 6:  tell
Speaker 6:  her
Speaker 6:  your
Speaker 6:  process
Speaker 6:  but
Speaker 6:  don't
Speaker 6:  try
Speaker 6:  to
Speaker 6:  convince
Speaker 6:  her
Speaker 6:  okay
Speaker 6:  do you
Speaker 6:  understand
Speaker 6:  and
Speaker 6:  most
Speaker 6:  of the
Speaker 6:  time
Speaker 6:  talk
Speaker 6:  less
Speaker 6:  and
Speaker 6:  touch
Speaker 6:  more
Speaker 6:  talk
Speaker 6:  less
Speaker 6:  you
Speaker 6:  over
Speaker 6:  talk
Speaker 18:  you
Speaker 18:  think
Speaker 18:  you
Speaker 18:  know
Speaker 18:  that
Speaker 18:  about
Speaker 18:  him
Speaker 6:  yep
Speaker 6:  you
Speaker 6:  know
Speaker 6:  because
Speaker 6:  it
Speaker 6:  is
Speaker 6:  the
Speaker 6:  one
Speaker 6:  language
Speaker 6:  between
Speaker 6:  the
Speaker 6:  two
Speaker 6:  of
Speaker 6:  you
Speaker 6:  that
Speaker 6:  never
Speaker 6:  got
Speaker 6:  contaminated
Speaker 6:  yeah
Speaker 6:  and
Speaker 6:  that
Speaker 6:  is
Speaker 6:  very
Speaker 6:  special
Speaker 6:  because
Speaker 6:  in
Speaker 6:  most
Speaker 6:  situations
Speaker 6:  it
Speaker 6:  could
Speaker 6:  be
Speaker 6:  exactly
Speaker 6:  the
Speaker 6:  reverse
Speaker 6:  so
Speaker 6:  when
Speaker 6:  she
Speaker 6:  gets
Speaker 6:  upset
Speaker 6:  half
Speaker 6:  the
Speaker 6:  time
Speaker 6:  all
Speaker 6:  you
Speaker 6:  need
Speaker 6:  to
Speaker 6:  do
Speaker 6:  is
Speaker 6:  hold
Speaker 6:  her
Speaker 6:  and
Speaker 6:  just
Speaker 6:  say
Speaker 6:  I'm
Speaker 6:  here
Speaker 6:  and
Speaker 6:  for
Speaker 6:  the
Speaker 6:  rest
Speaker 6:  if
Speaker 6:  you
Speaker 6:  allow
Speaker 6:  me
Speaker 6:  shut
Speaker 6:  the
Speaker 6:  fuck
Speaker 6:  up
Speaker 7:  good
Speaker 7:  advice
Speaker 6:  what
Speaker 6:  you're
Speaker 6:  saying
Speaker 6:  is
Speaker 6:  meant
Speaker 6:  is
Speaker 6:  meant
Speaker 6:  really
Speaker 6:  well
Speaker 6:  and it's
Speaker 6:  not coming
Speaker 6:  across
Speaker 7:  I know
Speaker 7:  so
Speaker 6:  you just
Speaker 6:  hold her
Speaker 6:  and at
Speaker 6:  the best
Speaker 6:  you tell
Speaker 6:  her
Speaker 6:  it's okay
Speaker 6:  don't talk
Speaker 6:  and you stay
Speaker 6:  for a moment
Speaker 6:  quiet
Speaker 6:  sad
Speaker 6:  we have
Speaker 6:  we have
Speaker 6:  each other
Speaker 6:  and it
Speaker 6:  is freaking
Speaker 6:  uncertain
Speaker 6:  the reason
Speaker 6:  this woman
Speaker 6:  or this
Speaker 6:  couple
Speaker 6:  will be
Speaker 6:  able
Speaker 6:  to overcome
Speaker 6:  this
Speaker 6:  and to
Speaker 6:  turn this
Speaker 6:  tragedy
Speaker 6:  into a
Speaker 6:  triumph
Speaker 6:  is because
Speaker 6:  the rest
Speaker 6:  of their
Speaker 6:  life
Speaker 6:  was so
Speaker 6:  solid
Speaker 6:  it is
Speaker 6:  because
Speaker 6:  they had
Speaker 6:  a good
Speaker 6:  marriage
Speaker 6:  it is
Speaker 6:  because
Speaker 6:  they had
Speaker 6:  a good
Speaker 6:  sexual
Speaker 6:  relationship
Speaker 6:  particularly
Speaker 6:  because they
Speaker 6:  had a good
Speaker 6:  sexual relationship
Speaker 6:  it is because
Speaker 6:  he has been
Speaker 6:  there for her
Speaker 6:  so I think
Speaker 6:  they can overcome
Speaker 6:  it because
Speaker 6:  they have
Speaker 6:  a very rich
Speaker 6:  tapestry
Speaker 6:  that has
Speaker 6:  never wavered
