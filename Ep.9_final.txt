Speaker 1:  Welcome to the Audible Original Series, Where Should We Begin, with Esther Perel.
Speaker 1:  There's more Esther coming soon. Season 2 of this series and her new audiobook, The State of Affairs.
Speaker 1:  Learn more at audible.com slash Esther. That's audible.com slash E-S-T-H-E-R.
Speaker 2:  What you're about to hear is an unscripted, one-time couples counseling session.
Speaker 2:  It contains mature themes and listener discretion is advised.
Speaker 2:  For the purposes of maintaining confidentiality, names and some identifiable characteristics have been removed.
Speaker 2:  But their voices and their stories are real.
Speaker 3:  From the intake interview, I learned a few things about this couple.
Speaker 3:  They are in a kind of a talking versus touching battle of sorts.
Speaker 4:  We are extremely different people and with different communication styles.
Speaker 4:  So like, I'm verbal. He's more communicative through touch, which sometimes can trigger me.
Speaker 40:  I'm a very touchy-feely kind of physical person.
Speaker 40:  That kind of creates that self-beating loop of neither one of us are able to give what the other one truly needs.
Speaker 3:  There is a long-standing history of cheating described as a sex addiction.
Speaker 4:  So sex addiction has really been an ongoing issue for me since I was a teenager.
Speaker 40:  I found out he was cheating on me.
Speaker 40:  Just random hookups and meeting guys online and doing what guys do.
Speaker 40:  It was very, very heartbreaking.
Speaker 4:  So he found out, which, long story short, I kind of was hoping he would because I knew I needed help at that point.
Speaker 3:  And the revelation of the cheating, which then became a revelation about an out-of-control sexuality, then became a revelation of an out-of-control violence in his childhood.
Speaker 4:  I've been diagnosed with PTSD. I've got a history of trauma.
Speaker 4:  And for so long, I've been trying to push that away.
Speaker 40:  It was either counseling and trying to figure all this out or kind of throw away 14 years.
Speaker 3:  And so part of what I want to do is to parse out what is what, what intersects with what, what may have led to what, and where can the healing, the change, and the growth come from.
Speaker 2:  This is Where Should We Begin with Esther Perel.
Speaker 3:  What's one conversation with him that you would like to have?
Speaker 5:  Being able to have a better understanding of triggers from his past.
Speaker 5:  He and I have talked before where we've related it to kind of walking through a minefield.
Speaker 5:  Sometimes you're doing fine, but then you take that one wrong step and everything unravels.
Speaker 5:  So being able to navigate those kind of situations better, for sure, for his own mental health and for mine.
Speaker 3:  Is there one that you have been able to identify that, you know, on a few occasions I'd said or did something and...
Speaker 5:  I think probably the most recent one is his birthday.
Speaker 5:  My idea for his birthday was to, since we had just recently moved to Minneapolis, we had been talking about going to a lot of these little, just little fun landmarks.
Speaker 5:  The Mary Tyler Moore statue, the Bob Dylan mural, those kind of things.
Speaker 5:  And we'd just never done it. We'd been there for two years and it's always, oh, we'll get to it later.
Speaker 5:  So I thought, we'll jump in the car and just kind of travel around and I'll take him to all these fun little places.
Speaker 3:  Blindfolded.
Speaker 5:  No blindfold, just unknowingly.
Speaker 5:  What?
Speaker 6:  Because that's what it felt like.
Speaker 6:  And we finally got to that point.
Speaker 5:  So my idea of fun, that spontaneous and excitement of the unknowing.
Speaker 5:  So let's go do this.
Speaker 5:  You know, I had the whole day planned out, lunch at a certain place that we talked about, and then it never got that far.
Speaker 5:  I noticed something was kind of going on when we were at home.
Speaker 5:  He was kind of just dragging his feet and kind of hemming and hawing when he was getting ready.
Speaker 5:  But we got in the car and started talking and he kind of shared a little bit that he didn't like the surprise aspect.
Speaker 5:  And he's like, well, I can tell you if you need to know.
Speaker 5:  I can tell you exactly what we're doing.
Speaker 5:  He said, no, it's fine.
Speaker 5:  You can manage it.
Speaker 5:  And by the second location, he's like, okay, no, I can't do this anymore.
Speaker 5:  So.
Speaker 7:  And I kind of look at that and go, there was a breakthrough.
Speaker 7:  Because we circled back around and talked about all of this, right?
Speaker 7:  And what I learned was I'd been isolating myself with these thoughts in my head.
Speaker 7:  So I was getting anxiety about all of these surprises that were happening.
Speaker 7:  And I felt like I was being blindfolded and put into a car and then taken, you know, on this wild goose stage, which I knew nothing about.
Speaker 7:  And only then did I realize that I'm not sharing my process of what's going on in my head with him.
Speaker 7:  And he's asking.
Speaker 7:  And I'm saying, well.
Speaker 8:  He's even asking, should I tell you where we're going?
Speaker 7:  But I wanted desperately to not have anxiety around that.
Speaker 7:  Like I wanted the surprise, I'm getting all teary-eyed.
Speaker 7:  I wanted desperately, I wanted for his surprise to be a good positive thing for me.
Speaker 7:  And here I am going, I can do this, I can do this, I can do this, I can do this.
Speaker 7:  Which really made the anxiety even worse.
Speaker 7:  So what I learned, what we have learned from that was that I need to include him in what's going on in my head.
Speaker 7:  I can't just assume that when I say, oh, I have anxiety, he understands what that means.
Speaker 7:  Like, he knows a little bit about the trauma of my past and what kind of triggers this.
Speaker 3:  He knows a little bit means what?
Speaker 7:  He knows trauma has happened.
Speaker 7:  He knows that he's physically abused and sexually abused early on.
Speaker 7:  So he knows those things.
Speaker 7:  He doesn't know the specifics around them.
Speaker 7:  And then that also, I think, plays.
Speaker 3:  And the reason he knows not more is by choice of you or of him or of lack of the vocabulary?
Speaker 7:  The language.
Speaker 7:  Yes, that's a big piece of it.
Speaker 7:  But also for understanding that my memory isn't there.
Speaker 7:  I have blocked out so many pieces of that.
Speaker 7:  And that's something that I'm working on with my own personal therapist.
Speaker 7:  At first, I thought that he wanted to know all the icky parts.
Speaker 7:  Because he just wanted to be like, oh, he's got all this trauma from his past.
Speaker 7:  And I just want to hold you and coddle you.
Speaker 7:  What I'm finding is he wants to know the icky parts so that he understands the process of what's happening in my brain.
Speaker 7:  Because he doesn't want to add to that.
Speaker 12:  Is that accurate?
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it is.
Speaker 5:  You know, I've often related to, I see him hurting, but I don't know how to help.
Speaker 3:  Do you need to know what it is in order to comfort him?
Speaker 3:  Or can you comfort him just because you see he's distressed or he's upset?
Speaker 5:  I can definitely comfort him without knowing.
Speaker 3:  Does he let you?
Speaker 5:  Sometimes.
Speaker 5:  Sometimes.
Speaker 5:  You know, we're very different end of the spectrum.
Speaker 5:  He's very much words.
Speaker 5:  I'm very much touch in action.
Speaker 5:  So trying to speak his kind of language of what he needs is something I'm still trying to learn how to do.
Speaker 5:  I'm not a big talker.
Speaker 5:  I'm the quiet listener.
Speaker 5:  So in those respects it works out well.
Speaker 3:  But maybe he talks when he should be touched.
Speaker 3:  And you should not learn from him.
Speaker 5:  When there's that physical recoil from that touch.
Speaker 5:  Am I doing more harm than good?
Speaker 7:  So sometimes that does happen.
Speaker 7:  And it does take me a few minutes to lean into that.
Speaker 7:  Because I realize that, yeah, I'm recoiling from this person that I've been with for 14 years.
Speaker 7:  So again, there are elements of guilt around that.
Speaker 7:  I'm like, holy smokes, that must not feel great to him.
Speaker 7:  You know, because here's your beloved coming to touch you.
Speaker 7:  And I'm like, oh, hold on, hold on.
Speaker 7:  But it takes me a few minutes to kind of go, okay, all right, I'm safe.
Speaker 3:  One of the many ways to begin to understand trauma is that it is an overwhelming experience
Speaker 3:  that often induces terror and helplessness.
Speaker 3:  To which we then respond from the place of our reptilian brain.
Speaker 3:  Fight, flight, or freeze.
Speaker 3:  And as my colleague Bessel van der Kolk has so beautifully stated,
Speaker 3:  when it comes to trauma, the body keeps the score.
Speaker 3:  So while he thinks it's his mind, when he recoils, it's a body that recoils.
Speaker 3:  And it recoils and it freezes and it closes off in order to protect.
Speaker 3:  20 years later, how does he let his body know that this time he doesn't need to recoil?
Speaker 3:  That this is a person who is coming to make him feel good and not take advantage of him.
Speaker 7:  Honestly, I have to say in my head, I'm safe.
Speaker 7:  This is a good thing.
Speaker 7:  This is the person I love the most.
Speaker 7:  This is the safest place where I am in the world.
Speaker 7:  Do I think that that's ridiculous that I have to say that to myself?
Speaker 7:  Yes, I do.
Speaker 3:  No.
Speaker 3:  No.
Speaker 7:  Thank you.
Speaker 3:  No.
Speaker 3:  It's wonderful that you can speak to the scared part in you, to the scared boy in you,
Speaker 3:  that needs a moment to differentiate between loving touch and hurtful touch.
Speaker 3:  And grounds you in reality, in the moment and says, hey, no, we love each other and he's coming to comfort me.
Speaker 3:  And I can let myself trust him and he will hold me and I will feel safe.
Speaker 3:  Nothing ridiculous about that.
Speaker 3:  All good.
Speaker 7:  I want that to be something that is just innate, something that is just normal.
Speaker 7:  Do most people recoil from somebody who hugs?
Speaker 3:  Most people who experience what you have may.
Speaker 3:  Normality comes in many forms.
Speaker 3:  What you do, the natural language you have at that moment to hold him, is exactly what needs to be.
Speaker 3:  And when he recoils, stay steady.
Speaker 3:  It has nothing to do with you.
Speaker 3:  He doesn't recoil from you.
Speaker 3:  It's very hard to believe that.
Speaker 3:  Right.
Speaker 3:  Because I'm sure so many times you have touched him and his shoulders go up and you think,
Speaker 3:  who else is he rejecting if not me?
Speaker 3:  I'm the one holding him.
Speaker 3:  But it's not.
Speaker 3:  It is and it's not.
Speaker 3:  It's signaling to himself, this is comfort.
Speaker 3:  This is love.
Speaker 3:  This is care.
Speaker 3:  This is gentle.
Speaker 3:  But his body memory needs a moment to determine this.
Speaker 3:  So you let him do his translation.
Speaker 3:  And you just stay steady.
Speaker 3:  And you just say, he's adjusting the dials.
Speaker 5:  I get into that self-doubt or is it really me?
Speaker 5:  So it does bring up those kind of self-esteem questions or why is he pulling away from me?
Speaker 5:  What have I done?
Speaker 5:  For sure.
Speaker 12:  And now?
Speaker 5:  And now the more I learn about him and that past trauma, I can see that it's not.
Speaker 5:  And it may sometimes take me a few minutes to readjust my internal dials, as you said, to go, wait a minute, it's not.
Speaker 5:  Stay fast and kind of do what I know.
Speaker 7:  Stay fast and kind of do what I know.
Speaker 7:  Shortly after I know.
Speaker 7:  Stay fast and po Dana can understand my actually kind of economy, I can see you all.
Speaker 7: book of sticking with me, it looks more kapital, however chirocians, as your ally.
Speaker 7:  And instead of making, like, oh, I want to go to Kamehra, Houghton, I feel, hey, I can see you next year and time again?
Speaker 7:  Stay sharp and forward!
Speaker 7:  Stay warm and sad and joy!
Speaker 7:  Stay warm, happy and happy and enjoy here, I will stay for you tonight, too.
Speaker 3:  Awesome!
Speaker 3:  Howard I know if I can't go to AH한다, that I have to work saらな moaning, the way so that I care
Speaker 3:  wanted to go to my body, I can't claim it.
Speaker 7:  I'm really cool, I can't get a mhm monsieur to gotcha, the way around my experience.
Speaker 7: usta Lumia.
Speaker 7:  I can't say anything.
Speaker 7:  you're worthless
Speaker 7:  and if I see him as an extension
Speaker 7:  of me then am I saying
Speaker 7:  those things
Speaker 7:  to him
Speaker 5:  probably
Speaker 5:  you've never said those words
Speaker 5:  no
Speaker 5:  those feelings for sure
Speaker 3:  who spoke to you this way
Speaker 7:  that's something I've learned
Speaker 7:  from my parents
Speaker 3:  both of them
Speaker 7:  I grew up in a very volatile environment
Speaker 7:  yes
Speaker 7:  and even just saying those words
Speaker 7:  sounds very clinical
Speaker 7:  but because I'm trying to remove
Speaker 7:  obviously I'm trying to remove
Speaker 7:  the emotion from that
Speaker 3:  and if you didn't
Speaker 7:  I'd be pissed off
Speaker 3:  and you'd say
Speaker 7:  that wasn't right
Speaker 7:  that wasn't fair
Speaker 7:  no I grew up in a
Speaker 7:  a shitty environment
Speaker 7:  a really shitty environment
Speaker 7:  very hostile
Speaker 7:  very abusive
Speaker 7:  very demeaning
Speaker 7:  environment
Speaker 3:  and when I talk
Speaker 3:  to myself
Speaker 3:  in this way
Speaker 3:  and I say
Speaker 3:  stupid
Speaker 3:  idiot
Speaker 3:  the fuck is wrong with you
Speaker 3:  worthless piece of shit
Speaker 3:  who's talking?
Speaker 3:  where did I learn it
Speaker 3:  and who did it to me?
Speaker 7:  my parents
Speaker 7:  my mom
Speaker 7:  my dad
Speaker 7:  now
Speaker 7:  I've just begun
Speaker 7:  to wade in
Speaker 7:  and to begin to
Speaker 7:  dig in deep
Speaker 7:  into the stuff
Speaker 7:  I see our relationship
Speaker 7:  changing
Speaker 7:  for the positive
Speaker 7:  even with
Speaker 7:  who would have ever thought
Speaker 7:  that
Speaker 7:  my acting out
Speaker 7:  with my sexual addiction
Speaker 7:  whoever would have thought
Speaker 7:  that this
Speaker 7:  this
Speaker 7:  the worst thing
Speaker 7:  that could have ever happened
Speaker 7:  in our 14 years
Speaker 7:  who would have ever thought
Speaker 7:  that this would actually
Speaker 7:  bring us to a place
Speaker 7:  of
Speaker 7:  a year later
Speaker 7:  getting married
Speaker 7:  we just got married
Speaker 3:  congratulations
Speaker 3:  thank you
Speaker 7:  thank you
Speaker 3:  and you're making a connection?
Speaker 3:  yeah
Speaker 3:  how?
Speaker 7:  by some of the things
Speaker 7:  that we're talking about already
Speaker 3:  in a relationship
Speaker 3:  we often will
Speaker 3:  establish a type
Speaker 3:  of status quo
Speaker 3:  it's the stuff
Speaker 3:  I'm willing to live with
Speaker 3:  given
Speaker 3:  the implicit contract
Speaker 3:  that exists
Speaker 3:  between us
Speaker 3:  the unspoken contract
Speaker 3:  but when there is a crisis
Speaker 3:  it upsets
Speaker 3:  the status quo
Speaker 3:  by which things
Speaker 3:  that I was willing
Speaker 3:  to live with
Speaker 3:  I may no longer
Speaker 3:  want to accept
Speaker 3:  at this point
Speaker 3:  and that
Speaker 3:  actually
Speaker 3:  becomes a source
Speaker 3:  for change
Speaker 3:  and movement
Speaker 3:  you needed this
Speaker 3:  to unleash something
Speaker 3:  between the two of you?
Speaker 7:  I've never
Speaker 7:  we've never been so
Speaker 7:  I have never been so honest
Speaker 7:  about
Speaker 7:  my history
Speaker 7:  or my past
Speaker 7:  that this
Speaker 3:  provided
Speaker 3:  he has never been
Speaker 3:  more demanding
Speaker 3:  for once
Speaker 5:  yeah
Speaker 5:  I've definitely
Speaker 5:  started pushing him
Speaker 5:  more
Speaker 5:  on it
Speaker 11:  on it
Speaker 11:  or on
Speaker 11:  meeting you
Speaker 11:  on
Speaker 5:  sharing with me
Speaker 5:  his past
Speaker 5:  on letting me in
Speaker 5:  a little bit more
Speaker 5:  on helping me
Speaker 5:  to understand
Speaker 5:  what's going on
Speaker 5:  in his head
Speaker 5:  before
Speaker 5:  when he said
Speaker 5:  he didn't want to talk about it
Speaker 5:  it's like okay
Speaker 5:  I don't want to push
Speaker 5:  I don't want to
Speaker 12:  but I'm asking you
Speaker 5:  something else
Speaker 5:  for sure
Speaker 5:  so
Speaker 3:  are you more
Speaker 3:  demanding
Speaker 3:  for yourself now
Speaker 5:  I think so
Speaker 5:  I think when all this happened
Speaker 5:  one of the things
Speaker 5:  I did not do
Speaker 5:  is take responsibility
Speaker 5:  his acting out
Speaker 5:  was
Speaker 5:  I
Speaker 5:  think I actually said
Speaker 5:  this is not me
Speaker 5:  I've done
Speaker 5:  nothing wrong
Speaker 3:  and that's not
Speaker 3:  typically you
Speaker 3:  no
Speaker 5:  I'm
Speaker 5:  I'm the caregiver
Speaker 5:  I take care of
Speaker 5:  everybody else
Speaker 3:  how did it feel
Speaker 3:  to ask for something
Speaker 3:  for you
Speaker 5:  scary
Speaker 5:  but good
Speaker 12:  scary how
Speaker 5:  it's that fear
Speaker 5:  of rejection
Speaker 5:  do I deserve this
Speaker 5:  should I be doing this
Speaker 5:  and the answer is yes
Speaker 5:  resoundingly
Speaker 5:  and it's just getting
Speaker 5:  my head around that
Speaker 5:  to say
Speaker 5:  I can put myself first
Speaker 5:  when it's appropriate
Speaker 5:  when
Speaker 5:  I do
Speaker 5:  need
Speaker 5:  that
Speaker 5:  which
Speaker 5:  is more often
Speaker 5:  than I'd actually do
Speaker 5:  for sure
Speaker 3:  yes because what you
Speaker 3:  deem appropriate
Speaker 3:  is when it's
Speaker 3:  massive crisis
Speaker 3:  right
Speaker 3:  and we're gonna need
Speaker 3:  to learn to ask
Speaker 3:  for more
Speaker 3:  even when the house
Speaker 3:  is not on fire
Speaker 3:  yep
Speaker 3:  so where did you
Speaker 3:  learn
Speaker 3:  to live on
Speaker 3:  crumbs
Speaker 3:  he's not the only
Speaker 3:  one with the history
Speaker 5:  oh yeah
Speaker 5:  for sure
Speaker 5:  I never saw it
Speaker 5:  as that though
Speaker 5:  it's normality
Speaker 5:  you always
Speaker 5:  do for others
Speaker 3:  yes but what you're
Speaker 3:  telling me is
Speaker 3:  I don't need much
Speaker 3:  I make sure
Speaker 3:  not to need much
Speaker 3:  so nobody can say no
Speaker 3:  true
Speaker 5:  I'm a pretty low
Speaker 5:  maintenance person
Speaker 5:  though
Speaker 3:  oh you've got it
Speaker 3:  nicely rationalized
Speaker 3:  you're not getting
Speaker 3:  away with that
Speaker 3:  no
Speaker 3:  wrapped in a
Speaker 3:  I'm a low
Speaker 3:  maintenance
Speaker 3:  kind of guy
Speaker 3:  and then I meet
Speaker 3:  myself
Speaker 3:  this wonderful
Speaker 3:  boyfriend
Speaker 3:  who is a super
Speaker 3:  high maintenance
Speaker 3:  kind of guy
Speaker 3:  so I
Speaker 3:  get to preserve
Speaker 3:  the title
Speaker 5:  wait
Speaker 5:  whoa
Speaker 3:  his drama
Speaker 3:  is always
Speaker 3:  bigger than
Speaker 3:  yours
Speaker 5:  this is true
Speaker 5:  very true
Speaker 3:  his history
Speaker 3:  will always
Speaker 3:  be shittier
Speaker 3:  than yours
Speaker 4:  wow
Speaker 3:  his family
Speaker 3:  will always
Speaker 3:  be shittier
Speaker 3:  than yours
Speaker 4:  yeah
Speaker 3:  and he needs
Speaker 3:  to cheat
Speaker 3:  on you
Speaker 3:  for you
Speaker 3:  finally
Speaker 3:  to say
Speaker 3:  I want
Speaker 3:  something
Speaker 3:  now
Speaker 3:  which is
Speaker 3:  great
Speaker 3:  but he shouldn't
Speaker 3:  have to cheat
Speaker 3:  on you
Speaker 3:  for you to
Speaker 3:  say
Speaker 3:  I need more
Speaker 3:  true
Speaker 3:  so where
Speaker 3:  did you learn
Speaker 3:  to refrain
Speaker 3:  from asking
Speaker 3:  wanting
Speaker 3:  needing
Speaker 3:  I think
Speaker 5:  it starts
Speaker 5:  with
Speaker 5:  not wanting
Speaker 5:  to be noticed
Speaker 5:  growing up
Speaker 5:  as that
Speaker 5:  little gay
Speaker 5:  boy
Speaker 5:  if you
Speaker 5:  don't need
Speaker 5:  much
Speaker 5:  you're not
Speaker 5:  going to
Speaker 5:  be noticed
Speaker 5:  so you
Speaker 5:  can fly
Speaker 5:  another
Speaker 5:  radar
Speaker 5:  I learned
Speaker 5:  how to hunt
Speaker 5:  and fish
Speaker 5:  and
Speaker 5:  be in
Speaker 5:  boy scouts
Speaker 5:  and play
Speaker 5:  little league
Speaker 5:  and
Speaker 5:  do what
Speaker 5:  you were
Speaker 5:  supposed to
Speaker 3:  what did
Speaker 3:  you want
Speaker 3:  them to
Speaker 3:  say
Speaker 5:  what a
Speaker 5:  great
Speaker 5:  person
Speaker 5:  I am
Speaker 5:  that I
Speaker 5:  do have
Speaker 5:  something
Speaker 5:  to offer
Speaker 3:  does he
Speaker 3:  know your
Speaker 3:  pain
Speaker 3:  because it's
Speaker 3:  so much
Speaker 3:  his triggers
Speaker 3:  his pain
Speaker 3:  his drama
Speaker 3:  not to
Speaker 3:  minimize it
Speaker 3:  but there's
Speaker 3:  an imbalance
Speaker 3:  sure
Speaker 3:  ask him
Speaker 3:  more
Speaker 7:  what did
Speaker 7:  it feel
Speaker 7:  like
Speaker 7:  when you
Speaker 7:  were
Speaker 7:  fitting in
Speaker 7:  like
Speaker 7:  what did
Speaker 7:  it feel
Speaker 7:  like
Speaker 7:  when you
Speaker 7:  were
Speaker 7:  with
Speaker 7:  this
Speaker 7:  group
Speaker 7:  of
Speaker 7:  straight
Speaker 7:  guys
Speaker 7:  out
Speaker 7:  hunting
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 5:  just
Speaker 5:  didn't
Speaker 5:  want
Speaker 5:  to
Speaker 5:  be
Speaker 5:  there
Speaker 5:  I
Speaker 5:  love
Speaker 5:  being
Speaker 5:  out
Speaker 5:  in
Speaker 5:  nature
Speaker 5:  but
Speaker 5:  to
Speaker 5:  kill
Speaker 5:  something
Speaker 5:  no
Speaker 5:  as
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  listen
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  him
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  begin
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  wonder
Speaker 3:  what
Speaker 3:  is
Speaker 3:  his
Speaker 3:  silence
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  get
Speaker 3:  a
Speaker 3:  sense
Speaker 3:  that
Speaker 3:  both
Speaker 3:  men
Speaker 3:  have
Speaker 3:  an
Speaker 3:  unexplored
Speaker 3:  side
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  themselves
Speaker 3:  a
Speaker 3:  story
Speaker 3:  that
Speaker 3:  was
Speaker 3:  never
Speaker 3:  told
Speaker 3:  a
Speaker 3:  truth
Speaker 3:  about
Speaker 3:  themselves
Speaker 3:  that
Speaker 3:  could
Speaker 3:  never
Speaker 3:  be
Speaker 3:  safely
Speaker 3:  expressed
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  so
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  begin
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  ask
Speaker 3:  him
Speaker 3:  did
Speaker 5:  they
Speaker 5:  know
Speaker 5:  my
Speaker 5:  brother
Speaker 5:  knew
Speaker 5:  and
Speaker 5:  never
Speaker 5:  told
Speaker 5:  my
Speaker 5:  father
Speaker 5:  he
Speaker 5:  passed
Speaker 3:  so
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  never
Speaker 3:  came
Speaker 3:  out
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  him
Speaker 5:  not
Speaker 5:  to
Speaker 5:  my
Speaker 5:  father
Speaker 5:  no
Speaker 3:  why
Speaker 3:  didn't
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  tell
Speaker 3:  your
Speaker 3:  dad
Speaker 5:  I
Speaker 5:  ask
Speaker 5:  myself
Speaker 5:  that
Speaker 5:  a
Speaker 5:  lot
Speaker 5:  I
Speaker 5:  think
Speaker 5:  it
Speaker 5:  was
Speaker 5:  just
Speaker 5:  that
Speaker 5:  fear
Speaker 5:  of
Speaker 5:  disappointment
Speaker 5:  do
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  hear
Speaker 3:  yourself
Speaker 3:  saying
Speaker 3:  it
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  him
Speaker 5:  I
Speaker 5:  do
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  when
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  hear
Speaker 3:  yourself
Speaker 3:  saying
Speaker 3:  it
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  him
Speaker 3:  now
Speaker 5:  he
Speaker 5:  says
Speaker 5:  I
Speaker 5:  already
Speaker 5:  knew
Speaker 5:  and
Speaker 5:  why
Speaker 5:  are
Speaker 5:  we
Speaker 5:  talking
Speaker 5:  about
Speaker 5:  this
Speaker 3:  what's
Speaker 3:  it
Speaker 3:  like
Speaker 3:  for
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 5:  in
Speaker 5:  part
Speaker 5:  it's
Speaker 5:  a
Speaker 5:  relief
Speaker 5:  because
Speaker 5:  he
Speaker 5:  goes
Speaker 5:  okay
Speaker 5:  great
Speaker 5:  he
Speaker 5:  already
Speaker 5:  understands
Speaker 5:  it
Speaker 5:  I
Speaker 5:  don't
Speaker 5:  need
Speaker 5:  to
Speaker 5:  waste
Speaker 5:  time
Speaker 5:  on
Speaker 5:  it
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  the
Speaker 3:  other
Speaker 3:  part
Speaker 5:  says
Speaker 5:  why
Speaker 5:  don't
Speaker 5:  you
Speaker 5:  want
Speaker 5:  to
Speaker 5:  get
Speaker 5:  to
Speaker 5:  know
Speaker 5:  me
Speaker 5:  better
Speaker 12:  say
Speaker 12:  again
Speaker 5:  why
Speaker 5:  don't
Speaker 5:  you
Speaker 5:  want
Speaker 5:  to
Speaker 5:  get
Speaker 5:  to
Speaker 5:  know
Speaker 5:  me
Speaker 5:  better
Speaker 5:  to
Speaker 5:  do
Speaker 5:  I
Speaker 5:  think
Speaker 5:  is
Speaker 5:  one
Speaker 5:  reason
Speaker 5:  why
Speaker 5:  I
Speaker 5:  do
Speaker 5:  press
Speaker 5:  a
Speaker 5:  little
Speaker 5:  bit
Speaker 5:  harder
Speaker 5:  on
Speaker 5:  getting
Speaker 5:  to
Speaker 5:  know
Speaker 5:  him
Speaker 5:  because
Speaker 5:  I
Speaker 5:  am
Speaker 5:  trying
Speaker 5:  to
Speaker 5:  undo
Speaker 5:  that
Speaker 5:  especially
Speaker 5:  for
Speaker 5:  myself
Speaker 3:  yes
Speaker 3:  but
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  want
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  press
Speaker 3:  him
Speaker 3:  on
Speaker 3:  getting
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  know
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 5:  that's
Speaker 5:  the
Speaker 5:  other
Speaker 5:  side
Speaker 5:  of
Speaker 5:  that
Speaker 5:  if
Speaker 5:  he's
Speaker 5:  willing
Speaker 5:  to
Speaker 5:  share
Speaker 5:  that
Speaker 5:  with
Speaker 5:  me
Speaker 5:  then
Speaker 5:  I
Speaker 5:  think
Speaker 5:  that
Speaker 5:  again
Speaker 5:  not
Speaker 5:  having
Speaker 5:  that
Speaker 5:  vocabulary
Speaker 5:  in
Speaker 5:  words
Speaker 5:  gives
Speaker 5:  me
Speaker 5:  permission
Speaker 5:  to do
Speaker 12:  how
Speaker 12:  you
Speaker 12:  doing
Speaker 12:  good
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  have
Speaker 7:  not
Speaker 7:  been
Speaker 7:  able
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  access
Speaker 7:  this
Speaker 7:  you
Speaker 15:  can
Speaker 15:  come
Speaker 15:  near
Speaker 15:  him
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  was
Speaker 7:  wanting
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  was
Speaker 7:  sitting
Speaker 7:  here
Speaker 7:  watching
Speaker 7:  you
Speaker 7:  get
Speaker 7:  emotional
Speaker 7:  but
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  have
Speaker 7:  not
Speaker 7:  been
Speaker 7:  able
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  access
Speaker 7:  this
Speaker 3:  just
Speaker 3:  tell
Speaker 3:  him
Speaker 3:  what
Speaker 3:  it's
Speaker 3:  like
Speaker 3:  for
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  listen
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  him
Speaker 14:  when
Speaker 14:  I
Speaker 14:  hear
Speaker 14:  you
Speaker 7:  when
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  say
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  need
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  learn
Speaker 7:  how
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  be
Speaker 7:  a
Speaker 7:  better
Speaker 7:  nurturer
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  see
Speaker 7:  that
Speaker 7:  and
Speaker 7:  go
Speaker 7:  oh
Speaker 7:  my
Speaker 7:  gosh
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  want
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  nurture
Speaker 7:  this
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  want
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  get
Speaker 7:  closer
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  want
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  hug
Speaker 7:  you
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  want
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  hold
Speaker 7:  you
Speaker 7:  do
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  want
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  do
Speaker 3:  it
Speaker 3:  what
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  just
Speaker 3:  said
Speaker 14:  hug
Speaker 14:  him
Speaker 14:  and
Speaker 14:  hold
Speaker 14:  him
Speaker 14:  and
Speaker 14:  touch
Speaker 14:  yes
Speaker 14:  then
Speaker 14:  go
Speaker 14:  ahead
Speaker 14:  shut
Speaker 14:  up
Speaker 14:  I
Speaker 14:  do
Speaker 14:  when
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  listen
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  am
Speaker 3:  moved
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  am
Speaker 3:  sad
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  am
Speaker 3:  grateful
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  am
Speaker 3:  full
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  feel
Speaker 3:  what
Speaker 3:  it
Speaker 7:  pulls
Speaker 7:  me
Speaker 7:  closer
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  you
Speaker 7:  it
Speaker 7:  affords
Speaker 7:  me
Speaker 7:  the
Speaker 7:  opportunity
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  nurture
Speaker 7:  you
Speaker 7:  a
Speaker 7:  little
Speaker 7:  bit
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  think
Speaker 7:  Esther
Speaker 7:  really
Speaker 7:  touched
Speaker 7:  on
Speaker 7:  a
Speaker 7:  point
Speaker 7:  when
Speaker 7:  she
Speaker 7:  said
Speaker 7:  that
Speaker 7:  my
Speaker 7:  shit
Speaker 7:  there's
Speaker 7:  a
Speaker 7:  huge
Speaker 7:  imbalance
Speaker 7:  because
Speaker 7:  here
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  am
Speaker 7:  with
Speaker 7:  all
Speaker 7:  of
Speaker 7:  my
Speaker 7:  stuff
Speaker 7:  and
Speaker 7:  then
Speaker 7:  here
Speaker 7:  you
Speaker 7:  are
Speaker 7:  saying
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  don't
Speaker 7:  need
Speaker 7:  very
Speaker 7:  much
Speaker 7:  and
Speaker 7:  so
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  go
Speaker 7:  okay
Speaker 7:  well
Speaker 7:  then
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  can
Speaker 7:  provide
Speaker 7:  that
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  can
Speaker 7:  provide
Speaker 7:  not
Speaker 7:  very
Speaker 7:  much
Speaker 7:  so
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  don't
Speaker 7:  often
Speaker 7:  feel
Speaker 7:  like
Speaker 7:  a
Speaker 7:  really
Speaker 7:  great
Speaker 7:  mate
Speaker 7:  because
Speaker 7:  I'm
Speaker 7:  going
Speaker 7:  okay
Speaker 7:  well
Speaker 7:  I'm
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  can
Speaker 7:  provide
Speaker 7:  you
Speaker 7:  those
Speaker 7:  scraps
Speaker 7:  and
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  don't
Speaker 7:  want
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  provide
Speaker 7:  you
Speaker 7:  those
Speaker 7:  scraps
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  want
Speaker 7:  a
Speaker 7:  whole
Speaker 7:  healthy
Speaker 7:  like
Speaker 7:  enveloping
Speaker 7:  wrap
Speaker 7:  around
Speaker 7:  like
Speaker 7:  that's
Speaker 7:  what
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  want
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  just
Speaker 7:  didn't
Speaker 7:  know
Speaker 7:  how
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  access
Speaker 7:  and
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  would
Speaker 3:  just
Speaker 3:  say
Speaker 3:  tell
Speaker 3:  me
Speaker 3:  more
Speaker 3:  we've
Speaker 3:  been
Speaker 3:  talking
Speaker 3:  about
Speaker 3:  me
Speaker 3:  for
Speaker 3:  a
Speaker 3:  long
Speaker 3:  time
Speaker 7:  right
Speaker 7:  I'm
Speaker 7:  sick
Speaker 7:  of
Speaker 7:  talking
Speaker 7:  about
Speaker 3:  myself
Speaker 3:  so
Speaker 3:  then
Speaker 3:  ask
Speaker 3:  him
Speaker 3:  tell
Speaker 3:  me
Speaker 3:  more
Speaker 3:  because
Speaker 3:  this
Speaker 3:  is
Speaker 3:  a
Speaker 3:  lie
Speaker 3:  in
Speaker 3:  your
Speaker 3:  relationship
Speaker 3:  it's
Speaker 3:  not
Speaker 3:  an
Speaker 3:  intentional
Speaker 3:  lie
Speaker 3:  but
Speaker 3:  it's
Speaker 3:  a
Speaker 3:  lie
Speaker 3:  this
Speaker 3:  idea
Speaker 3:  that
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  don't
Speaker 3:  need
Speaker 3:  much
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  that
Speaker 3:  it
Speaker 3:  needed
Speaker 3:  infidelity
Speaker 3:  for you
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  finally
Speaker 3:  say
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  want
Speaker 3:  something
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  unequivocally
Speaker 3:  demand it
Speaker 3:  good for
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  one of
Speaker 3:  the
Speaker 3:  things
Speaker 3:  that
Speaker 3:  infidelity
Speaker 3:  sometimes
Speaker 3:  does
Speaker 3:  is
Speaker 3:  it
Speaker 3:  finally
Speaker 3:  makes
Speaker 3:  the
Speaker 3:  person
Speaker 3:  who
Speaker 3:  always
Speaker 3:  puts
Speaker 3:  their
Speaker 3:  needs
Speaker 3:  last
Speaker 3:  say
Speaker 3:  now
Speaker 3:  me
Speaker 3:  too
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  think
Speaker 3:  that
Speaker 3:  if
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  ask
Speaker 3:  for
Speaker 3:  more
Speaker 3:  things
Speaker 3:  will
Speaker 3:  change
Speaker 3:  the
Speaker 3:  focus
Speaker 3:  on
Speaker 3:  his
Speaker 3:  triggers
Speaker 3:  is
Speaker 3:  too
Speaker 3:  seductive
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  touch
Speaker 3:  because
Speaker 3:  you've
Speaker 3:  learned
Speaker 3:  not
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  talk
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  you've
Speaker 3:  learned
Speaker 3:  not
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  talk
Speaker 3:  because
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  fear
Speaker 3:  the
Speaker 3:  consequences
Speaker 3:  of
Speaker 3:  talking
Speaker 3:  because
Speaker 3:  the
Speaker 3:  first
Speaker 3:  thing
Speaker 3:  that
Speaker 3:  would
Speaker 3:  have
Speaker 3:  come
Speaker 3:  out
Speaker 3:  of
Speaker 3:  your
Speaker 3:  mouth
Speaker 3:  is
Speaker 3:  I'm
Speaker 3:  gay
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  am
Speaker 3:  who
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  am
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  may
Speaker 3:  not
Speaker 3:  be
Speaker 3:  the
Speaker 3:  son
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  imagined
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  so
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  learn
Speaker 3:  not
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  talk
Speaker 3:  so
Speaker 3:  we've
Speaker 3:  got
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  who
Speaker 3:  learned
Speaker 3:  not
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  talk
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  we've
Speaker 3:  got
Speaker 3:  him
Speaker 3:  who
Speaker 3:  overtalks
Speaker 3:  but
Speaker 3:  says
Speaker 3:  not
Speaker 3:  much
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  mean
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  know
Speaker 3:  what
Speaker 3:  I'm
Speaker 3:  saying
Speaker 3:  I'm
Speaker 3:  not
Speaker 3:  mean
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  be
Speaker 3:  a
Speaker 3:  great
Speaker 3:  self-esteem
Speaker 3:  it's a
Speaker 3:  kind
Speaker 3:  of
Speaker 3:  talking
Speaker 3:  when
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  get
Speaker 3:  nervous
Speaker 7:  it's
Speaker 7:  a
Speaker 7:  bait
Speaker 7:  and
Speaker 7:  sway
Speaker 7:  it
Speaker 7:  doesn't
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  have
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  suppose
Speaker 3:  there
Speaker 3:  are
Speaker 3:  a
Speaker 3:  lot
Speaker 3:  of
Speaker 3:  things
Speaker 3:  or
Speaker 3:  some
Speaker 3:  things
Speaker 3:  that
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  would
Speaker 3:  like
Speaker 3:  from
Speaker 3:  him
Speaker 3:  when
Speaker 3:  it
Speaker 3:  comes
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  sexuality
Speaker 3:  between
Speaker 3:  the
Speaker 3:  two
Speaker 3:  of
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 5:  for
Speaker 5:  sure
Speaker 5:  I tend
Speaker 5:  to
Speaker 5:  see
Speaker 5:  making
Speaker 5:  love
Speaker 5:  and
Speaker 5:  sex
Speaker 5:  as
Speaker 5:  a
Speaker 5:  fun
Speaker 5:  spontaneous
Speaker 5:  exciting
Speaker 5:  kind
Speaker 5:  of
Speaker 5:  thing
Speaker 5:  so
Speaker 5:  it's
Speaker 5:  how I
Speaker 5:  feel
Speaker 5:  loved
Speaker 5:  and
Speaker 5:  know
Speaker 5:  I'm
Speaker 5:  loved
Speaker 3:  this
Speaker 3:  is a
Speaker 3:  couple
Speaker 3:  who
Speaker 3:  in the
Speaker 3:  beginning
Speaker 3:  thought
Speaker 3:  that they
Speaker 3:  were
Speaker 3:  going to
Speaker 3:  come
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  talk
Speaker 3:  about
Speaker 3:  their
Speaker 3:  sexuality
Speaker 3:  together
Speaker 3:  that they
Speaker 3:  were
Speaker 3:  going to
Speaker 3:  come
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  talk
Speaker 3:  about
Speaker 3:  their
Speaker 3:  sexual
Speaker 3:  relationship
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  we
Speaker 3:  have
Speaker 3:  now
Speaker 3:  spent
Speaker 3:  at
Speaker 3:  least
Speaker 3:  two
Speaker 3:  hours
Speaker 3:  in
Speaker 3:  the
Speaker 3:  trenches
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  so
Speaker 3:  now
Speaker 3:  we're
Speaker 3:  going
Speaker 3:  to
Speaker 3:  connect
Speaker 3:  some
Speaker 3:  of
Speaker 3:  the
Speaker 3:  dots
Speaker 3:  between
Speaker 3:  the
Speaker 3:  background
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  the
Speaker 3:  consequences
Speaker 5:  I hope
Speaker 5:  you know
Speaker 5:  that
Speaker 5:  the
Speaker 5:  physicality
Speaker 5:  of our
Speaker 5:  relationship
Speaker 5:  is one
Speaker 5:  of my
Speaker 5:  favorite
Speaker 5:  things
Speaker 5:  and I
Speaker 5:  do want
Speaker 5:  more of
Speaker 5:  that
Speaker 5:  whether
Speaker 5:  it's
Speaker 5:  complete
Speaker 5:  naked
Speaker 5:  sex
Speaker 5:  fun
Speaker 5:  spontaneous
Speaker 5:  hugs
Speaker 5:  like
Speaker 5:  the other
Speaker 5:  day
Speaker 5:  when
Speaker 5:  we're
Speaker 5:  in
Speaker 5:  the
Speaker 5:  kitchen
Speaker 5:  and
Speaker 5:  you
Speaker 5:  came
Speaker 5:  up
Speaker 5:  and
Speaker 5:  hugged
Speaker 5:  me
Speaker 5:  and
Speaker 5:  kissed
Speaker 5:  me
Speaker 5:  and
Speaker 5:  just
Speaker 5:  said
Speaker 5:  thank you
Speaker 5:  and I
Speaker 5:  love
Speaker 5:  you
Speaker 5:  for
Speaker 5:  I
Speaker 5:  forget
Speaker 5:  what
Speaker 5:  I
Speaker 5:  was
Speaker 5:  doing
Speaker 5:  making
Speaker 5:  dinner
Speaker 5:  or
Speaker 5:  whatever
Speaker 5:  I do
Speaker 5:  want more
Speaker 5:  of that
Speaker 5:  I need
Speaker 5:  more
Speaker 5:  of that
Speaker 5:  do
Speaker 15:  do you
Speaker 15:  do you
Speaker 15:  tell him
Speaker 15:  I love
Speaker 15:  it
Speaker 15:  when he
Speaker 15:  does
Speaker 15:  it
Speaker 5:  not
Speaker 5:  always
Speaker 5:  it's
Speaker 5:  something
Speaker 5:  new
Speaker 5:  for him
Speaker 5:  to be
Speaker 5:  doing
Speaker 5:  and it's
Speaker 5:  something
Speaker 5:  new
Speaker 5:  for me
Speaker 5:  to reinforce
Speaker 5:  it
Speaker 5:  that
Speaker 3:  you both
Speaker 3:  need to
Speaker 3:  do more
Speaker 3:  of
Speaker 3:  you do
Speaker 3:  and you
Speaker 3:  tell him
Speaker 3:  it feels
Speaker 3:  great
Speaker 3:  so that
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  blatantly
Speaker 3:  reinforce
Speaker 3:  each other
Speaker 3:  and
Speaker 3:  you don't
Speaker 3:  have to
Speaker 3:  say I
Speaker 3:  do this
Speaker 3:  because I
Speaker 3:  know it's
Speaker 3:  important
Speaker 3:  to you
Speaker 3:  you can

Speaker 7:  my mind
Speaker 7:  just really
Speaker 7:  went
Speaker 7:  and expanded
Speaker 7:  my mind
Speaker 7:  no it
Speaker 7:  really did
Speaker 7:  because
Speaker 7:  I'm
Speaker 7:  thinking
Speaker 7:  I do
Speaker 7:  this
Speaker 7:  because
Speaker 7:  it's
Speaker 7:  fulfilling
Speaker 7:  a need
Speaker 7:  not
Speaker 7:  I'm
Speaker 7:  doing
Speaker 7:  this
Speaker 7:  because

Speaker 7:  as well
Speaker 7:  and I
Speaker 7:  enjoy

Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  want
Speaker 7:  you

Speaker 7:  without
Speaker 7:  question
Speaker 7:  that
Speaker 7:  you're
Speaker 7:  the most
Speaker 7:  important
Speaker 7:  person
Speaker 7:  to me
Speaker 7:  okay
Speaker 3:  when I
Speaker 3:  come
Speaker 3:  in the
Speaker 3:  kitchen
Speaker 3:  and I
Speaker 3:  hug
Speaker 3:  you
Speaker 3:  spontaneously
Speaker 3:  I
Speaker 3:  feel
Speaker 7:  when I
Speaker 7:  come
Speaker 7:  into the
Speaker 7:  kitchen
Speaker 7:  and hug
Speaker 7:  you
Speaker 7:  spontaneously
Speaker 7:  it feels
Speaker 7:  foreign
Speaker 7:  to me
Speaker 7:  I
Speaker 7:  feel
Speaker 7:  I feel
Speaker 7:  I'm not
Speaker 7:  used to
Speaker 7:  it
Speaker 7:  and
Speaker 7:  I feel
Speaker 7:  like
Speaker 7:  like almost
Speaker 7:  there has to
Speaker 7:  be a purpose
Speaker 7:  like it can't
Speaker 7:  just be because
Speaker 7:  I love you
Speaker 7:  that I'm coming
Speaker 7:  in here
Speaker 7:  and doing it
Speaker 7:  and I want to be
Speaker 7:  connected to you
Speaker 7:  it's almost
Speaker 7:  very purposeful
Speaker 7:  so
Speaker 7:  I don't feel
Speaker 7:  immediately connected
Speaker 7:  I do after I do it
Speaker 7:  and I see the way
Speaker 7:  you respond
Speaker 7:  then I go
Speaker 7:  okay
Speaker 7:  this is a good thing
Speaker 7:  this is bringing us
Speaker 7:  closer
Speaker 3:  this is a good thing
Speaker 3:  or it feels
Speaker 3:  good
Speaker 7:  it feels
Speaker 7:  good
Speaker 3:  do you know
Speaker 3:  the difference
Speaker 3:  right now
Speaker 3:  when you're
Speaker 3:  holding his hand
Speaker 3:  it's a good thing
Speaker 3:  or it feels
Speaker 3:  good
Speaker 7:  it feels
Speaker 7:  good
Speaker 3:  you know
Speaker 7:  I do know
Speaker 3:  you sure
Speaker 7:  I do
Speaker 7:  but I think
Speaker 7:  it's a good thing
Speaker 7:  because it does
Speaker 7:  feel good
Speaker 7:  it feels
Speaker 7:  good
Speaker 7:  feels scary
Speaker 7:  to me
Speaker 7:  I'm scared
Speaker 7:  of being
Speaker 7:  vulnerable
Speaker 7:  I'm scared
Speaker 7:  of
Speaker 7:  letting go
Speaker 7:  I'm scared
Speaker 7:  of
Speaker 7:  and I really
Speaker 7:  have issues
Speaker 7:  with this
Speaker 7:  being
Speaker 7:  submissive
Speaker 7:  isn't even
Speaker 7:  the right word
Speaker 7:  I trust you
Speaker 7:  wholeheartedly
Speaker 7:  I trust you
Speaker 7:  but that place
Speaker 7:  kind of scares
Speaker 7:  me too
Speaker 3:  that fear
Speaker 3:  that
Speaker 3:  resonance
Speaker 3:  of submissiveness
Speaker 3:  which
Speaker 3:  he knows
Speaker 3:  in the moment
Speaker 3:  is not
Speaker 3:  the right word
Speaker 3:  but in the past
Speaker 3:  was the
Speaker 3:  imposed
Speaker 3:  position
Speaker 3:  this is the
Speaker 3:  remnants of
Speaker 3:  sexual abuse
Speaker 3:  talking
Speaker 3:  what
Speaker 3:  could he do
Speaker 3:  other things
Speaker 3:  that he can do
Speaker 3:  with you
Speaker 3:  that would
Speaker 3:  help you
Speaker 3:  anchor
Speaker 7:  I think
Speaker 7:  by taking
Speaker 7:  my hand
Speaker 7:  and kind of
Speaker 7:  focusing
Speaker 7:  focusing me
Speaker 7:  because my
Speaker 7:  I get spun up
Speaker 7:  and my brain
Speaker 7:  goes
Speaker 3:  so you want him
Speaker 3:  to hold your face
Speaker 3:  just
Speaker 3:  with his two hands
Speaker 3:  go ahead
Speaker 7:  I want you to
Speaker 7:  hold my face
Speaker 3:  and I want you
Speaker 3:  to keep your eyes
Speaker 3:  open
Speaker 3:  so that you
Speaker 3:  can't leave
Speaker 7:  yes
Speaker 7:  I want you
Speaker 7:  to
Speaker 7:  this would
Speaker 7:  be nice
Speaker 7:  this
Speaker 7:  feels
Speaker 7:  really nice
Speaker 7:  this feels
Speaker 7:  safe
Speaker 7:  this is good
Speaker 7:  on my neck
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna try
Speaker 7:  on my face
Speaker 7:  right
Speaker 3:  but you want him
Speaker 3:  to lock
Speaker 3:  the gaze
Speaker 3:  you want
Speaker 3:  him to make
Speaker 3:  sure that you
Speaker 3:  see that it's
Speaker 3:  him
Speaker 3:  correct
Speaker 3:  and not any
Speaker 3:  of the other
Speaker 3:  jerks
Speaker 3:  right
Speaker 3:  and you want
Speaker 3:  him to say
Speaker 3:  something
Speaker 3:  do you want him
Speaker 3:  to say it's me
Speaker 3:  we're alright
Speaker 7:  yes
Speaker 7:  I do
Speaker 7:  what do you want him
Speaker 7:  to say
Speaker 7:  it's alright
Speaker 7:  I'm here
Speaker 5:  it's alright

Speaker 5:  as do I
Speaker 5:  I feel
Speaker 5:  I feel
Speaker 5:  I feel
Speaker 5:  like
Speaker 5:  it's very strange
Speaker 3:  don't talk
Speaker 3:  no
Speaker 3:  if the tears
Speaker 3:  come
Speaker 3:  just let them
