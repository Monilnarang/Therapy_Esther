[00:00.000 --> 00:06.160]  Welcome to the Audible Original Series, Where Should We Begin, with Esther Perel.
[00:06.880 --> 00:13.880]  There's more Esther coming soon. Season 2 of this series and her new audiobook, The State of Affairs.
[00:14.580 --> 00:23.200]  Learn more at audible.com slash Esther. That's audible.com slash E-S-T-H-E-R.
[00:23.720 --> 00:28.560]  What you're about to hear is an unscripted, one-time couples counseling session.
[00:28.560 --> 00:32.200]  It contains mature themes and listener discretion is advised.
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.940]  For the purposes of maintaining confidentiality, names and some identifiable characteristics have been removed.
[00:39.600 --> 00:42.440]  But their voices and their stories are real.
[00:47.260 --> 00:50.800]  We met each other in college, an opera scenes workshop, actually.
[00:51.200 --> 00:55.440]  Our director kept putting us in scenes together, and by the end of the term we finally figured out
[00:55.440 --> 00:58.880]  that, oh, that romantic thing that you were doing, well, that was actually real.
[00:59.000 --> 01:00.480]  That wasn't just acting.
[01:02.420 --> 01:06.500]  Desire and attraction. That has never been there for us.
[01:06.960 --> 01:11.580]  And we were part of what was called the evangelical purity culture movement of the late 90s.
[01:12.360 --> 01:14.100]  We have changed our views since then.
[01:14.360 --> 01:16.920]  We're both spiritual sort of people.
[01:17.040 --> 01:19.320]  I guess I tend more toward the atheistic side now.
[01:19.320 --> 01:24.380]  But it was really important to us to remain pure until marriage.
[01:27.880 --> 01:30.820]  My husband and I didn't kiss until we got engaged.
[01:31.160 --> 01:33.320]  And the night that I got engaged, I kicked him.
[01:33.800 --> 01:37.680]  And even though my heart and my head knew I was totally in love with this man,
[01:38.220 --> 01:41.240]  my body was screaming, no, this is not right.
[01:41.240 --> 01:50.740]  We're two survivors of childhood sexual abuse who managed to find one another, get married,
[01:50.940 --> 01:53.480]  and then find out that we were sexually mismatched.
[01:53.560 --> 02:00.620]  But not only that, we were sort of, you know, each of us within our own cauldron of sexual confusion and dysfunction.
[02:01.820 --> 02:05.140]  Anytime I try to have sex with him, I feel like I'm forcing myself.
[02:05.300 --> 02:06.400]  It feels incestuous.
[02:06.940 --> 02:10.780]  Two years ago, my adult sexuality came bursting out.
[02:11.240 --> 02:14.440]  I ended up realizing that I really loved sex.
[02:14.640 --> 02:16.600]  I just did not love sex with my husband.
[02:18.680 --> 02:20.680]  She would like sex to be much more energetic.
[02:20.920 --> 02:23.720]  I'd like it to come out of a place where I feel safe.
[02:24.660 --> 02:27.000]  I'm not willing to walk away from my marriage.
[02:27.440 --> 02:31.060]  But what I need to know is, can we learn to be attracted to one another?
[02:41.240 --> 02:51.860]  So when I listen to this couple, I am imagining that sex for these two people at this point has become a subject that is so fraught,
[02:51.860 --> 02:56.840]  that is mired in pain, in trauma, and that is very serious.
[02:57.340 --> 03:00.480]  And that from that place, not much change can come.
[03:00.620 --> 03:11.720]  So I'm thinking, how do I guide them to at least one experience where sexuality for them can be experienced with lightness, with fun, with joy?
[03:11.720 --> 03:16.500]  People come in with a story.
[03:17.020 --> 03:21.080]  At the end of the first session, I want them to live with a different story.
[03:21.200 --> 03:26.540]  Because a different story is what breeds hope, is what gives them the sense of possibility.
[03:26.540 --> 03:33.220]  And this is Where Should We Begin? with Esther Perel.
[03:44.660 --> 03:46.360]  You need a new perspective.
[03:47.500 --> 03:52.980]  Otherwise, it's going to be one more interesting chat, but with no movement.
[03:53.160 --> 03:55.400]  And then you start to feel more hopeless each time.
[03:56.540 --> 04:03.340]  So I want a tiny bit more info, just so I have a sense of what you've done, because I understand I'm not the first person you're speaking with.
[04:03.760 --> 04:07.660]  But I also have this idea that maybe you would do the entire session.
[04:08.480 --> 04:09.600]  There's two options.
[04:09.920 --> 04:12.500]  One is, you change names.
[04:13.620 --> 04:15.760]  And then I thought, since you sing, right?
[04:15.960 --> 04:16.080]  Yeah.
[04:16.340 --> 04:22.740]  You could speak with different accents, but you need to become different people in play.
[04:22.740 --> 04:25.220]  Or I blindfold you.
[04:25.660 --> 04:27.660]  Or I ask you to close your eyes, basically.
[04:28.060 --> 04:30.800]  And you do the entire session without looking at each other.
[04:32.960 --> 04:33.980]  Which one do we?
[04:35.080 --> 04:37.460]  You can say no to all the above, of course.
[04:37.460 --> 04:39.580]  I will change names.
[04:39.580 --> 04:44.260]  But I would also be kind of curious to blindfold, because I am so...
[04:45.260 --> 04:48.560]  I people-please a lot by getting people's facial reactions.
[04:48.800 --> 04:52.220]  So I'm, like, looking at you for every single reaction, trying to judge it all.
[04:52.340 --> 04:55.820]  And if I was blindfolded, maybe I would be able to hear things in a different way.
[04:56.020 --> 04:58.560]  That's exactly the way I thought of it.
[04:58.760 --> 05:00.860]  I thought, how do I change your perspective?
[05:00.860 --> 05:05.240]  And if it gets uncomfortable or inane, we take... we stop.
[05:07.780 --> 05:10.580]  Just the first thing I think about when I see stuckness is,
[05:10.780 --> 05:12.680]  where do I introduce something completely new?
[05:13.480 --> 05:15.560]  Since she always sees him in a certain way,
[05:16.500 --> 05:18.860]  and she sees him as this man that is like this and that is...
[05:18.860 --> 05:21.260]  I thought, what if I close her eyes?
[05:22.360 --> 05:23.640]  She'll see something else.
[05:24.160 --> 05:26.640]  And in fact, she'll have to listen more.
[05:26.740 --> 05:27.840]  She'll have to sense more.
[05:27.940 --> 05:29.900]  She'll have to experience touch more.
[05:29.900 --> 05:31.420]  So that was really that.
[05:31.500 --> 05:32.660]  How do I change the perception?
[05:33.000 --> 05:33.720]  Oh, it'd be so interesting.
[05:33.800 --> 05:36.120]  What would happen if I closed her eyes for an entire session?
[05:36.580 --> 05:39.340]  So she had the scarf on her until almost till the end.
[05:41.260 --> 05:42.140]  Close your eyes.
[05:42.900 --> 05:43.880]  Put that thing on.
[05:44.500 --> 05:45.260]  I'll help you.
[05:45.620 --> 05:46.120]  Thank you.
[05:48.660 --> 05:51.060]  Well, I can certainly do the first option.
[05:51.500 --> 05:52.280]  The changing names?
[05:52.440 --> 05:54.040]  Yeah, because I have a character.
[05:54.580 --> 05:56.680]  This actually happened spontaneously.
[05:57.120 --> 05:59.600]  There's one that he just started speaking to me in French.
[05:59.600 --> 06:01.540]  And we call this character Jean-Claude.
[06:01.680 --> 06:03.440]  And it's everything that I wanted from a partner.
[06:03.560 --> 06:05.560]  He's very arrogant and sexy.
[06:05.860 --> 06:07.980]  And we've been playing with this for a couple of months now.
[06:08.020 --> 06:09.820]  And it's really helped a lot.
[06:10.040 --> 06:12.980]  But it's to the point where I'm just like, can Jean-Claude come home?
[06:13.300 --> 06:14.660]  Can Scott stay outside?
[06:15.180 --> 06:16.380]  And I think you've gotten a little...
[06:16.380 --> 06:18.740]  Is it fair to say you're a little jealous of Jean-Claude?
[06:18.740 --> 06:24.900]  I don't often bring him out spontaneously or without an invitation.
[06:25.840 --> 06:27.840]  Because it's not the person that I inhabit.
[06:28.500 --> 06:31.740]  But it's a person that I would like to inhabit more.
[06:31.820 --> 06:36.540]  And in my individual therapy, my therapist tries to encourage me to inhabit that character more.
[06:36.620 --> 06:38.620]  But that character has no sexual hang-ups.
[06:38.700 --> 06:40.080]  That character has no...
[06:40.080 --> 06:42.800]  None of the problems that I face.
[06:43.020 --> 06:44.120]  That is fantastic.
[06:44.120 --> 06:49.480]  But half of the problem with it is that she doesn't understand anything that I'm saying.
[06:50.240 --> 06:50.700]  Which means...
[06:50.700 --> 06:51.200]  On s'en fout.
[06:52.200 --> 06:53.800]  As they say, who cares?
[06:53.880 --> 06:54.460]  I know, right?
[06:54.660 --> 06:55.340]  It doesn't matter.
[06:55.360 --> 06:56.920]  She doesn't have to understand.
[06:57.240 --> 06:59.020]  She energetically gets you.
[06:59.540 --> 07:01.480]  It is actually wonderful.
[07:01.800 --> 07:02.020]  D'accord.
[07:03.320 --> 07:04.940]  And I will do the translation.
[07:05.260 --> 07:05.640]  Thank you.
[07:05.640 --> 07:08.680]  But, in a way, she doesn't need the words.
[07:08.820 --> 07:10.640]  Because she's going to sense you differently.
[07:10.900 --> 07:12.580]  She's going to see you differently.
[07:13.120 --> 07:17.240]  By not understanding you, she will actually see you differently.
[07:17.680 --> 07:18.940]  She has already.
[07:19.480 --> 07:21.640]  She will feel you differently.
[07:22.100 --> 07:25.860]  And all of that is equivalent to communication.
[07:27.920 --> 07:28.520]  So...
[07:28.520 --> 07:30.820]  Bonjour, Jean-Claude!
[07:30.820 --> 07:34.960]  Bonjour, Sté.
[07:36.120 --> 07:38.100]  It's like the French lesson, you know?
[07:40.020 --> 07:41.140]  Il est un peu nerveux.
[07:41.580 --> 07:43.140]  Bien sûr, bien sûr.
[07:44.720 --> 07:53.740]  Le plus important, the most important thing, is that Jean-Claude is as real to you as God.
[07:55.460 --> 07:58.600]  But Jean-Claude, one cooks, one makes love.
[07:58.600 --> 08:01.820]  One speaks one way, one speaks the other way.
[08:01.960 --> 08:06.500]  One holds himself in a certain tightness, the other one, as you say, has no hang-ups.
[08:06.820 --> 08:08.440]  And he lives inside of you.
[08:08.920 --> 08:11.840]  And if you can play him, then you are him.
[08:12.960 --> 08:14.700]  And you get to experience him.
[08:15.400 --> 08:17.600]  And you bifurcate the entire stuckness.
[08:19.900 --> 08:21.420]  Do you have another name, too?
[08:21.800 --> 08:24.840]  Oh, sometimes he calls me Jacqueline, when we're in the French.
[08:26.040 --> 08:26.480]  Super!
[08:26.480 --> 08:26.540]  Super!
[08:26.540 --> 08:26.940]  Super!
[08:28.940 --> 08:32.340]  When he is different, he calls you by a different name, too.
[08:33.460 --> 08:34.140]  That's it.
[08:34.280 --> 08:34.720]  We're done.
[08:36.840 --> 08:38.020]  You can go.
[08:39.700 --> 08:42.780]  And then I feel that people have given me the permission.
[08:43.120 --> 08:43.900]  They trust me.
[08:44.320 --> 08:47.260]  They trust me and they say, take us out of this mess.
[08:48.140 --> 08:48.780]  Help us.
[08:48.780 --> 08:52.460]  And I feel that that permission emboldens me.
[08:52.460 --> 08:55.880]  It allows me to then say, we're going to play together.
[08:55.880 --> 09:01.340]  And if at any point it stops feeling like it's play, we stop.
[09:01.340 --> 09:06.940]  Right now, I want to reach out and grab Scott's hand because I'm afraid, because I can't see.
[09:07.440 --> 09:09.680]  And I'm afraid of what Jean-Claude's going to be.
[09:09.780 --> 09:13.380]  And I want safe, familial Scott to hold my hand during this right now.
[09:13.740 --> 09:14.680]  And this is our problem.
[09:14.800 --> 09:15.500]  Too much cozy.
[09:15.500 --> 09:16.300]  Not enough.
[09:16.800 --> 09:18.120]  Not enough difference.
[09:19.720 --> 09:24.440]  You're welcome to go reach out for his hand, but you may find the hand of Jean-Claude.
[09:25.360 --> 09:26.680]  They're not so separate.
[09:27.060 --> 09:28.480]  One dangerous, one safe.
[09:30.220 --> 09:31.920]  Maybe Jean-Claude is safe, too.
[09:31.920 --> 09:35.980]  You've got it completely divided.
[09:36.600 --> 09:37.060]  Totally.
[09:37.580 --> 09:37.960]  So.
[09:39.580 --> 09:40.380]  Try it.
[09:45.520 --> 09:48.860]  You know, when you are touching Jean-Claude, it's a different grip.
[09:49.360 --> 09:54.660]  Scott usually has this lethargic limp, kind of no support.
[09:55.100 --> 09:57.440]  But with Jean-Claude, I feel you gripping my hand differently.
[09:57.560 --> 09:59.940]  I feel like my hand can relax in yours.
[09:59.940 --> 10:03.500]  It's very different from the way you normally hold my hand.
[10:03.680 --> 10:04.560]  I feel very strong.
[10:05.720 --> 10:09.300]  And as soon as I hear your accent, I get all giddy and I shiver a little bit.
[10:09.800 --> 10:12.880]  He feels powerful and strong.
[10:13.300 --> 10:14.000]  I love that.
[10:14.060 --> 10:15.660]  That's what I've always wanted for you.
[10:16.600 --> 10:20.680]  I've always wanted to be the one where you could be the one in charge and I didn't have to be.
[10:20.680 --> 10:22.680]  I love that.
[10:22.680 --> 10:23.680]  I love that.
[10:23.680 --> 10:25.680]  I love that.
[10:25.680 --> 10:30.120]  It's a bit difficult for Scott to relinquish.
[10:30.700 --> 10:31.760]  To let her prise.
[10:31.800 --> 10:32.700]  To let her prise.
[10:32.700 --> 10:32.720]  To let her prise.
[10:32.720 --> 10:33.160]  To let her prise.
[10:33.160 --> 10:33.680]  To let her prise.
[10:33.680 --> 10:34.340]  To let her prise.
[10:35.820 --> 10:38.360]  Scott struggles to let go.
[10:39.200 --> 10:39.980]  Et Jean-Claude?
[10:39.980 --> 10:44.200]  He's confident, Jean-Claude.
[10:45.360 --> 10:48.980]  Jean-Claude knows what he wants.
[10:48.980 --> 10:51.320]  What he's going to do.
[10:51.320 --> 10:55.860]  Jean-Claude always knows what he wants and what he's going to do.
[10:55.860 --> 10:59.140]  And that is so not Scott.
[10:59.700 --> 11:01.040]  That is so different then.
[11:01.040 --> 11:16.380]  He has been locked up in a basement with a key.
[11:16.380 --> 11:22.160]  And explain to me who had the key.
[11:22.680 --> 11:25.620]  Who locked him up or why did he lock himself up?
[11:25.680 --> 11:26.720]  My mother.
[11:28.100 --> 11:30.060]  My mother and my father.
[11:30.060 --> 11:31.060]  And my father.
[11:33.560 --> 11:36.880]  Now you're talking as Scott, so you can say it in English.
[11:37.740 --> 11:42.540]  My mom shut down my sexuality when I was just coming into it.
[11:43.820 --> 11:51.140]  And made it clear that I was not to be like my father, who enjoyed sex.
[11:51.400 --> 11:57.780]  I was not to be like other men who I think must have demanded sex of her.
[11:57.780 --> 11:59.840]  I was to be the good boy.
[12:00.340 --> 12:01.500]  I was to be the perfect husband.
[12:02.240 --> 12:04.940]  And she made me into something of a surrogate husband.
[12:05.520 --> 12:06.160]  Oversharing.
[12:07.100 --> 12:13.740]  And I, in response to that, shamed myself whenever I felt sexual.
[12:14.300 --> 12:19.720]  And tried to be only intellectual.
[12:20.040 --> 12:22.080]  In fact, I shut down all of my emotions.
[12:23.820 --> 12:26.320]  So you became part of the purity movement?
[12:27.100 --> 12:27.440]  Yes.
[12:27.440 --> 12:29.440]  The church, it gave you?
[12:29.440 --> 12:32.220]  The church gave me a place of safety.
[12:32.820 --> 12:38.760]  Where other people were supporting me in not being sexually active.
[12:39.320 --> 12:46.180]  Where it was sacred to be non-sexual before marriage.
[12:46.180 --> 12:52.120]  I mean, I became part of the religion mainly because it was a source of friends.
[12:52.700 --> 12:55.660]  It was a source of people who were like-minded, who wanted to be good.
[12:56.620 --> 12:59.920]  And who sanctified goodness above all else.
[12:59.920 --> 13:02.880]  So here's one thing I want to challenge.
[13:04.080 --> 13:06.120]  Scott good, Jean-Claude bad.
[13:08.560 --> 13:10.140]  Because that's more of the same.
[13:10.860 --> 13:11.340]  It is.
[13:11.340 --> 13:16.220]  I want you to imagine good and sexual.
[13:20.080 --> 13:26.940]  Because if you're going to use this very interesting line of sex is bad and dirty, but save it for the one you love.
[13:26.940 --> 13:38.760]  How do you make Jean-Claude sexual, adult, responsible, and good?
[13:40.380 --> 13:45.060]  Scott wants to be a good boy.
[13:45.320 --> 13:49.960]  And Jean-Claude is a bad boy.
[13:49.960 --> 13:55.720]  Well, that's good because I like bad boys.
[13:57.880 --> 13:59.820]  Scott doesn't like bad boys.
[13:59.820 --> 14:11.080]  Scott doesn't like bad boys.
[14:12.340 --> 14:15.920]  And Jacqueline loves the bad boys.
[14:15.920 --> 14:24.260]  And a part of why sometimes a woman likes the bad boy is not because she likes to be very, very clear.
[14:25.340 --> 14:29.260]  It's not because she likes the man to be a predator.
[14:31.080 --> 14:38.040]  But it's because the bad boy, as you described, knows to take care of himself perfectly well.
[14:38.260 --> 14:38.740]  Thank you.
[14:38.740 --> 14:50.240]  And so he frees her from having to feel responsible for him, for having to worry about him, from having to experience his anxiety.
[14:50.760 --> 14:56.860]  And so since he can let go and is in his pleasure, it frees her up to be in her pleasure.
[14:58.780 --> 14:59.460]  Yes.
[15:00.440 --> 15:03.200]  You want to put this in your own words, Madame Jacqueline?
[15:03.200 --> 15:03.700]  Yes.
[15:03.700 --> 15:04.200]  Yes.
[15:04.200 --> 15:08.460]  So often I feel like I'm editing myself around you sexually.
[15:08.460 --> 15:14.660]  I feel like if I breathe wrong, if I move wrong, if I'm too playful, if I'm too strong, that I will turn Scott off.
[15:14.660 --> 15:16.360]  Because that is what has happened.
[15:16.360 --> 15:24.160]  And I feel like when you are Jean-Claude, when you are connected to your passion and your badness, I feel like I am free to bring all of who I am.
[15:24.160 --> 15:26.000]  Jean-Claude would say that you believe me.
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.400]  Jean-Claude wants you to trust him.
[15:33.020 --> 15:38.460]  Jean-Claude wants you to know that he is holding your hand.
[15:40.840 --> 15:42.440]  Can you handle all of me?
[15:43.760 --> 15:50.600]  Jean-Claude can hold you.
[15:51.240 --> 15:53.680]  Jean-Claude can withstand the force of your desire.
[15:53.680 --> 15:56.040]  Jean-Claude doesn't feel threatened by it.
[15:56.560 --> 16:01.300]  You don't have to worry with Jean-Claude that you've held back for so many years.
[16:02.340 --> 16:03.300]  He's got you.
[16:05.100 --> 16:07.340]  I would love to believe that that is true.
[16:07.440 --> 16:09.920]  But wait, I need to check if that fits him.
[16:11.600 --> 16:12.480]  Je pense que oui.
[16:12.680 --> 16:12.860]  Oui?
[16:13.200 --> 16:14.060]  Oui, je pense que oui.
[16:16.300 --> 16:19.680]  C'est un petit parti de tout de mon être.
[16:19.680 --> 16:20.540]  Mm-hmm.
[16:21.420 --> 16:22.520]  C'est un petit 카�,ël ou c'est un petit aspect français.
[16:22.520 --> 16:23.020]  C'est cap, ou c'est une partie de personne.
[16:23.020 --> 16:23.880]  And oui, c'est un petit act, c'est un rappel sur mon miles understand ça.
[16:23.880 --> 16:25.400]  And, yes, c'est un peu.
[16:29.280 --> 16:32.340]  C'est un peu par however il faut que je suis, c'est un peu, c'est un peu bas...
[16:36.920 --> 16:39.960]  C'est un peu defarour de moi, parce que je suis, c'est un peu très cher par mais...
[16:39.960 --> 16:41.040]  C'est un peu baseman, c'est un peu Kont, c'est un peu comme il faut tournoir.
[16:41.040 --> 16:47.140]  too much and therefore you have to hold back, which you have now transferred onto, he can't
[16:47.140 --> 16:54.360]  handle me, and then made it his issue because he's too fragile and I have to protect him
[16:54.360 --> 16:56.900]  and therefore I have to mother him and I have to hold back.
[16:57.920 --> 17:01.200]  You're putting on him a fear that is yours.
[17:02.500 --> 17:08.340]  And the fantasy is if I felt and if I was with somebody hugely powerful, then I won't
[17:08.340 --> 17:09.180]  be too much.
[17:09.180 --> 17:17.480]  It's like the bigger they are, the more they can take me on versus maybe not too much.
[17:18.100 --> 17:20.880]  You have no idea on some level.
[17:24.620 --> 17:27.240]  So tell me about the I was too much at home.
[17:28.260 --> 17:29.140]  As a child?
[17:29.460 --> 17:32.560]  Oh, I was the black sheep of the family.
[17:32.760 --> 17:33.800]  I was too loud.
[17:33.920 --> 17:35.100]  I was too outspoken.
[17:35.100 --> 17:43.700]  And any time I did voice my opinions, I was verbally and emotionally abused to the point
[17:43.700 --> 17:45.400]  where I was just terrified.
[17:45.400 --> 17:49.900]  to feel what I feel, to express what I feel because it would just come with such a big
[17:49.900 --> 17:50.560]  smack down.
[17:51.360 --> 17:56.240]  And it's been great being with Scott because he's been the first person who has made it
[17:56.240 --> 18:00.180]  safe for me to talk about these truths with the exception of sexuality.
[18:00.860 --> 18:05.500]  In sexuality, I feel like I have tried to bring more of my wild side to you.
[18:05.500 --> 18:06.840]  And Scott.
[18:06.920 --> 18:07.260]  To him.
[18:07.920 --> 18:08.080]  Hmm?
[18:08.280 --> 18:08.540]  Sorry?
[18:08.620 --> 18:09.620]  Scott isn't here right now.
[18:09.720 --> 18:10.220]  Oh, sorry.
[18:10.920 --> 18:11.480]  Jean-Claude.
[18:13.000 --> 18:14.180]  I love that you can...
[18:14.180 --> 18:17.740]  You've brought your wild side to Scott and things didn't go well.
[18:17.980 --> 18:22.500]  But right now in this room, you're talking with Jean-Claude.
[18:23.340 --> 18:24.300]  Jean-Claude.
[18:24.300 --> 18:30.880]  Working with role play in therapy has a long tradition that comes from psychodrama that
[18:30.880 --> 18:32.260]  was started by Moreno.
[18:32.800 --> 18:38.920]  We have a tendency to get stuck in our role, in our own view of things, in the way I see
[18:38.920 --> 18:39.460]  us.
[18:39.880 --> 18:44.000]  A couple that has been together for a long time can often recite the other person's
[18:44.000 --> 18:44.900]  lines by heart.
[18:45.460 --> 18:48.100]  By now, they know exactly what the other one's going to say.
[18:48.740 --> 18:53.800]  And so you use role play to increase empathy.
[18:53.800 --> 18:58.160]  You use role play to step outside of the narrowness of one's own perspective.
[18:58.720 --> 19:03.760]  You use role play to give people the option to actually tell the other person what they
[19:03.760 --> 19:05.000]  would like to hear from them.
[19:07.980 --> 19:12.580]  Jean-Claude, I so want to open myself up to you.
[19:12.760 --> 19:17.660]  I want to bring everything of who I am to you and have you meet it with your energy.
[19:18.600 --> 19:20.020]  But can you...
[19:20.020 --> 19:21.840]  Can your spirit dance with mine?
[19:21.840 --> 19:25.120]  Can you not care if you look silly when you dance?
[19:25.220 --> 19:26.500]  Will you just dance with me anyway?
[19:27.160 --> 19:30.680]  Can you not care how droopy we get as we get older?
[19:30.920 --> 19:36.180]  Can you still look at me with lust for the spirit that's inside of me?
[19:37.120 --> 19:42.400]  Can you not shame me for the fact that I have wild fantasies and want to act them all
[19:42.400 --> 19:46.740]  out and that I'm not even remotely conservative like my family would like me to be?
[19:46.740 --> 19:49.780]  Can you not shame me for that?
[19:50.200 --> 19:55.200]  Can you say these are the things I love about you as opposed to the things that...
[19:55.200 --> 19:56.780]  These are the things I want to punish you for?
[19:58.360 --> 19:59.120]  Thank you.
[20:02.060 --> 20:02.500]  Monsieur.
[20:02.500 --> 20:06.520]  Madame.
[20:10.520 --> 20:14.300]  Je voudrais faire tout ça avec toi.
[20:15.460 --> 20:16.040]  Comme tu es.
[20:18.420 --> 20:20.820]  I want to do all of this with you.
[20:22.080 --> 20:23.160]  The way you are.
[20:24.880 --> 20:25.660]  Are you sure?
[20:25.660 --> 20:28.180]  Comme Jean-Claude?
[20:28.180 --> 20:28.420]  Oui.
[20:30.940 --> 20:31.860]  Comme Jean-Claude.
[20:33.380 --> 20:34.180]  Jean-Claude.
[20:34.460 --> 20:34.660]  Oui.
[20:35.280 --> 20:37.300]  Ce que Jacqueline a besoin d'entendre,
[20:37.620 --> 20:39.880]  what Jacqueline, I think, needs to hear from you,
[20:40.540 --> 20:44.320]  is that it is okay for her
[20:44.320 --> 20:48.380]  to bring out the full spectrum of her sexuality
[20:48.380 --> 20:51.920]  and that it won't be shamed
[20:51.920 --> 20:53.520]  or vilified
[20:53.520 --> 20:55.520]  or used
[20:55.520 --> 20:57.020]  or abused
[20:57.020 --> 20:58.480]  as it was.
[20:59.480 --> 21:01.340]  There is no greater vengeance
[21:01.340 --> 21:04.700]  than to be
[21:04.700 --> 21:07.260]  the most happy one can be.
[21:08.720 --> 21:12.400]  There is no greater vengeance against sexual abuse
[21:12.400 --> 21:14.540]  than to reclaim
[21:14.540 --> 21:16.360]  one's full sexuality
[21:16.360 --> 21:18.020]  and celebrate it.
[21:18.620 --> 21:19.500]  And this woman
[21:19.500 --> 21:21.560]  would like to celebrate with you.
[21:22.400 --> 21:24.460]  But when you have created together
[21:24.460 --> 21:25.340]  the family
[21:25.340 --> 21:28.560]  that you both didn't have,
[21:29.200 --> 21:30.980]  it feels like you can't bring
[21:30.980 --> 21:32.320]  that lustfulness home.
[21:33.260 --> 21:34.260]  So how do you
[21:34.260 --> 21:35.720]  bring lust home
[21:35.720 --> 21:37.740]  and how do you put the ex back in sex?
[21:39.300 --> 21:41.080]  Jean-Claude brings the ex.
[21:43.400 --> 21:45.240]  And Jacqueline brings the ex.
[21:46.360 --> 21:48.400]  So imagine Jacqueline
[21:48.400 --> 21:50.140]  reaching out
[21:50.140 --> 21:52.920]  to this Frenchman of yours.
[21:54.080 --> 21:55.160]  Il est grand, il est beau.
[21:55.540 --> 21:56.780]  He's tall, he's gorgeous.
[21:58.280 --> 21:59.760]  He knows what he wants.
[22:00.020 --> 22:01.080]  He's quite confident.
[22:01.580 --> 22:02.380]  He knows what he wants
[22:02.380 --> 22:03.360]  and what he wants is you.
[22:04.340 --> 22:05.840]  When he strokes your hand,
[22:05.900 --> 22:06.900]  he's not making sure
[22:06.900 --> 22:08.020]  if he's doing it right.
[22:08.240 --> 22:09.600]  He's doing what he enjoys.
[22:09.600 --> 22:12.380]  as he's doing right now.
[22:13.580 --> 22:15.880]  So breathe this in, Jacqueline.
[22:17.940 --> 22:19.040]  That's very different
[22:19.040 --> 22:21.100]  from the way Scott touches me.
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.460]  There's nothing tentative
[22:24.460 --> 22:26.100]  about Jean-Claude's touch.
[22:27.040 --> 22:27.980]  Jean-Claude touches
[22:27.980 --> 22:29.660]  with tenderness but intention.
[22:29.660 --> 22:32.500]  There's a certain pressure
[22:32.500 --> 22:33.460]  without force.
[22:33.680 --> 22:34.660]  There's no clumsiness.
[22:36.820 --> 22:37.780]  It's beautiful.
[22:38.020 --> 22:39.620]  It's what I've always wanted.
[22:40.320 --> 22:40.660]  Merci.
[22:42.660 --> 22:43.700]  C'est différent parce que tu...
[22:43.700 --> 22:44.340]  parce que tu...
[22:44.340 --> 22:45.700]  Je te touche
[22:45.700 --> 22:47.040]  pour mon plaisir.
[22:48.020 --> 22:48.540]  Super.
[22:49.600 --> 22:50.700]  It's different
[22:50.700 --> 22:53.260]  because when I touch you
[22:53.260 --> 22:54.300]  as Jean-Claude,
[22:54.860 --> 22:56.560]  I touch you
[22:56.560 --> 22:57.520]  for my pleasure.
[22:58.540 --> 22:58.800]  Hmm.
[23:00.260 --> 23:00.960]  And yet,
[23:01.040 --> 23:01.980]  I feel more pleasure
[23:01.980 --> 23:02.880]  because of it.
[23:04.420 --> 23:04.940]  Yes.
[23:05.720 --> 23:06.820]  It's so different.
[23:08.500 --> 23:09.700]  What they don't know
[23:09.700 --> 23:11.160]  is how to make the transition
[23:11.160 --> 23:13.520]  from not hurting
[23:13.520 --> 23:14.600]  to enjoying.
[23:15.920 --> 23:16.920]  That's the work.
[23:17.980 --> 23:19.320]  And a lot of the work
[23:19.320 --> 23:20.420]  on sexual trauma
[23:20.420 --> 23:22.400]  is often very good
[23:22.400 --> 23:23.720]  at healing the break
[23:23.720 --> 23:25.220]  and at putting on the cast
[23:25.220 --> 23:26.900]  and even at removing the cast.
[23:27.120 --> 23:28.200]  But it doesn't do
[23:28.200 --> 23:30.000]  the re-education afterwards.
[23:31.700 --> 23:33.060]  The re-education afterwards
[23:33.060 --> 23:34.440]  is the joy,
[23:34.580 --> 23:35.120]  the openness,
[23:35.360 --> 23:35.780]  the play,
[23:35.880 --> 23:36.300]  the freedom,
[23:36.420 --> 23:36.900]  the pleasure.
[23:40.240 --> 23:41.280]  Tu te touches
[23:41.280 --> 23:42.820]  comme je veux
[23:42.820 --> 23:45.160]  être touchée
[23:45.160 --> 23:46.140]  de toi.
[23:46.140 --> 23:46.520]  I touch you
[23:46.520 --> 23:48.060]  as I want to be touched
[23:48.060 --> 23:48.640]  by you.
[23:49.160 --> 23:50.140]  I touch you
[23:50.140 --> 23:50.880]  without the fear
[23:50.880 --> 23:51.900]  of being selfish.
[23:52.460 --> 23:52.740]  Oh.
[23:53.960 --> 23:54.420]  Oui?
[23:54.780 --> 23:55.680]  Oui, oui, c'est ça.
[23:56.120 --> 23:57.960]  Et sans peur
[23:57.960 --> 23:58.980]  de...
[23:58.980 --> 23:59.480]  de...
[23:59.480 --> 24:00.100]  de...
[24:00.100 --> 24:01.100]  de...
[24:01.100 --> 24:02.020]  criticism.
[24:02.020 --> 24:03.680]  I touch you
[24:03.680 --> 24:04.340]  without the fear
[24:04.340 --> 24:05.500]  of being criticised.
[24:05.700 --> 24:06.520]  I touch you
[24:06.520 --> 24:07.980]  as I enjoy
[24:07.980 --> 24:08.940]  to touch you,
[24:09.060 --> 24:10.040]  meaning I stay
[24:10.040 --> 24:11.400]  inside myself
[24:11.400 --> 24:12.600]  and I connect
[24:12.600 --> 24:13.280]  with you.
[24:15.660 --> 24:17.260]  He just rolled his eyes
[24:17.260 --> 24:17.760]  as saying,
[24:17.860 --> 24:18.620]  yes, yes, yes.
[24:19.300 --> 24:20.080]  Tuck, tuck, tuck.
[24:20.080 --> 24:23.660]  There's a naughty guy
[24:23.660 --> 24:24.160]  in there.
[24:24.760 --> 24:25.780]  Way more mischief
[24:25.780 --> 24:27.100]  than the world
[24:27.100 --> 24:27.840]  has ever met.
[24:28.540 --> 24:29.800]  Oh, bien sûr.
[24:30.180 --> 24:31.560]  Ah, bien sûr.
[24:32.060 --> 24:33.200]  I saw the way
[24:33.200 --> 24:34.140]  you stroked her
[24:34.140 --> 24:34.980]  as Jean-Claude.
[24:35.260 --> 24:36.460]  It's all inside
[24:36.460 --> 24:36.860]  of you.
[24:37.760 --> 24:38.860]  You are not
[24:38.860 --> 24:40.340]  incompatible,
[24:40.720 --> 24:41.360]  mismatched
[24:41.360 --> 24:41.940]  in everything
[24:41.940 --> 24:42.420]  you wrote
[24:42.420 --> 24:43.040]  on the paper.
[24:43.040 --> 24:47.340]  I don't know
[24:47.340 --> 24:47.740]  where you got
[24:47.740 --> 24:48.320]  that story,
[24:48.420 --> 24:49.480]  but it's not.
[24:49.780 --> 24:50.580]  You don't know
[24:50.580 --> 24:51.820]  what stuff
[24:51.820 --> 24:52.320]  goes into
[24:52.320 --> 24:53.300]  this guy's head,
[24:53.500 --> 24:54.400]  but it may not
[24:54.400 --> 24:54.880]  be nearly
[24:54.880 --> 24:55.440]  that different
[24:55.440 --> 24:56.100]  from yours.
[24:58.680 --> 24:59.880]  And now all my stuff
[24:59.880 --> 25:00.580]  is coming up
[25:00.580 --> 25:01.780]  because while
[25:01.780 --> 25:03.000]  I desire closeness,
[25:03.200 --> 25:04.120]  there's another part
[25:04.120 --> 25:04.760]  of me that's like,
[25:04.840 --> 25:05.220]  get the hell
[25:05.220 --> 25:05.780]  away from me.
[25:05.940 --> 25:07.040]  Like, there's
[25:07.040 --> 25:07.900]  protected walls
[25:07.900 --> 25:08.280]  that are like,
[25:08.340 --> 25:08.980]  okay, this was nice,
[25:09.060 --> 25:09.620]  too much closeness
[25:09.620 --> 25:10.380]  and you go over there.
[25:11.820 --> 25:12.780]  She has that moment
[25:12.780 --> 25:13.640]  of crosswire
[25:13.640 --> 25:14.960]  between come,
[25:15.060 --> 25:15.820]  come on to me,
[25:15.920 --> 25:16.400]  take me,
[25:16.540 --> 25:17.160]  be strong,
[25:17.520 --> 25:18.400]  but then the moment
[25:18.400 --> 25:19.820]  he actually does this
[25:19.820 --> 25:21.380]  because of who he is
[25:21.380 --> 25:22.380]  and the transference
[25:22.380 --> 25:23.000]  she has,
[25:23.420 --> 25:24.340]  it then switches
[25:24.340 --> 25:25.820]  into I'm subjugated
[25:25.820 --> 25:26.440]  and I just have
[25:26.440 --> 25:27.180]  to take it.
[25:27.900 --> 25:28.540]  And now we're
[25:28.540 --> 25:29.480]  in the trauma mode.
[25:29.880 --> 25:32.300]  So he becomes
[25:32.300 --> 25:33.280]  the man she wants
[25:33.280 --> 25:33.900]  him to be
[25:33.900 --> 25:35.420]  and he has the power
[25:35.420 --> 25:36.560]  she wants him to have,
[25:36.680 --> 25:37.580]  but then it becomes
[25:37.580 --> 25:38.720]  he's having power
[25:38.720 --> 25:39.460]  over her.
[25:40.580 --> 25:42.560]  So at 80 seconds,
[25:42.780 --> 25:44.060]  the story can jinx
[25:44.060 --> 25:46.260]  with the overlays
[25:46.260 --> 25:47.160]  of their respective
[25:47.160 --> 25:48.220]  childhood stories.
[25:48.420 --> 25:49.140]  Every second,
[25:49.320 --> 25:50.460]  it is a miracle
[25:50.460 --> 25:51.000]  these people
[25:51.000 --> 25:52.300]  manage to have sex
[25:52.300 --> 25:52.780]  on occasion.
[25:56.560 --> 25:58.020]  I hate needing you
[25:58.020 --> 25:59.060]  because I just want
[25:59.060 --> 25:59.860]  to feel independent.
[26:00.060 --> 26:00.500]  I don't want
[26:00.500 --> 26:01.360]  to need anyone.
[26:02.040 --> 26:02.580]  I feel like I have
[26:02.580 --> 26:03.140]  to apologize
[26:03.140 --> 26:04.620]  for everything that I am.
[26:05.320 --> 26:06.720]  That I am never enough.
[26:07.420 --> 26:08.760]  That I'm never beautiful enough.
[26:08.880 --> 26:09.740]  I'm never thin enough.
[26:09.740 --> 26:10.860]  I'm never talented enough.
[26:11.240 --> 26:12.760]  I don't say the right things.
[26:12.880 --> 26:13.720]  I'm too sexual.
[26:13.860 --> 26:14.840]  I'm too opinionated.
[26:14.980 --> 26:16.500]  I hurt you all the time.
[26:19.860 --> 26:21.200]  Then stop speaking.
[26:24.200 --> 26:25.140]  That was Scott.
[26:25.380 --> 26:26.840]  That was not a Sean Clark kiss.
[26:27.020 --> 26:27.360]  All right,
[26:27.580 --> 26:28.480]  let's do it again.
[26:28.660 --> 26:28.900]  D'accord.
[26:28.900 --> 26:40.060]  Don't speak and just
[26:40.060 --> 26:41.920]  allow yourself to be you.
[26:41.920 --> 26:45.580]  I feel like I was kissing
[26:45.580 --> 26:46.360]  a different person.
[26:46.560 --> 26:47.480]  That's a different kiss
[26:47.480 --> 26:49.160]  than what I normally get.
[26:49.440 --> 26:49.980]  I liked it.
[26:50.180 --> 26:51.280]  Shut the fuck.
[26:51.280 --> 27:03.160]  Ella.
[27:04.840 --> 27:05.480]  Do you feel good?
[27:07.080 --> 27:07.520]  Me?
[27:08.240 --> 27:09.160]  You feel okay?
[27:10.560 --> 27:11.900]  But why is this different?
[27:12.020 --> 27:13.120]  I have been begging you
[27:13.120 --> 27:14.840]  for this for years.
[27:15.500 --> 27:16.420]  You can't do that.
[27:18.720 --> 27:19.680]  You can't do what?
[27:20.640 --> 27:21.220]  You know,
[27:21.280 --> 27:21.680]  it's like,
[27:21.760 --> 27:22.260]  kiss me,
[27:22.400 --> 27:22.900]  kiss me,
[27:23.020 --> 27:23.440]  kiss me.
[27:23.480 --> 27:24.200]  I'm dying for you
[27:24.200 --> 27:24.760]  to kiss me.
[27:24.800 --> 27:26.080]  And when he finally kisses you,
[27:26.140 --> 27:26.500]  you say,
[27:26.640 --> 27:27.660]  what took you so long
[27:27.660 --> 27:28.300]  to kiss me?
[27:29.140 --> 27:29.580]  Yep.
[27:30.200 --> 27:32.220]  And this is the place
[27:32.220 --> 27:33.180]  where you need to challenge
[27:33.180 --> 27:34.540]  and just say,
[27:34.800 --> 27:36.120]  you're not invited here
[27:36.120 --> 27:36.840]  in this moment.
[27:39.220 --> 27:40.460]  And yet Jacqueline
[27:40.460 --> 27:42.560]  wants to be an adult.
[27:42.820 --> 27:44.120]  Jacqueline wants to find
[27:44.120 --> 27:44.760]  her sexuality
[27:44.760 --> 27:45.680]  and express it.
[27:46.460 --> 27:47.620]  And there's this war.
[27:47.620 --> 27:49.900]  Then I also understood
[27:49.900 --> 27:50.580]  that the struggle
[27:50.580 --> 27:51.220]  is actually,
[27:51.600 --> 27:52.400]  at that moment,
[27:52.540 --> 27:53.680]  the struggle is more with her.
[27:53.760 --> 27:54.680]  It goes back and forth.
[27:55.200 --> 27:55.500]  You know,
[27:55.560 --> 27:56.000]  one minute,
[27:56.100 --> 27:57.100]  one of them manages,
[27:57.280 --> 27:58.100]  but then the other one.
[27:58.600 --> 28:00.240]  And she was extraordinarily honest
[28:00.240 --> 28:00.800]  and saying,
[28:00.920 --> 28:01.520]  I'm not there.
[28:01.620 --> 28:01.860]  I am.
[28:01.980 --> 28:02.780]  I'm in this war.
[28:02.860 --> 28:03.540]  I'm in this battle
[28:03.540 --> 28:04.400]  inside my head.
[28:04.460 --> 28:04.860]  I want.
[28:04.940 --> 28:05.440]  I don't want.
[28:05.500 --> 28:06.160]  Can I trust?
[28:09.580 --> 28:10.760]  Is this the first time
[28:10.760 --> 28:11.560]  you own this,
[28:11.680 --> 28:12.660]  besides instead of
[28:12.660 --> 28:13.760]  all putting it on him?
[28:13.760 --> 28:14.960]  No, no.
[28:15.060 --> 28:15.840]  I've noticed this
[28:15.840 --> 28:16.500]  for the past,
[28:16.780 --> 28:18.040]  what, year or so?
[28:18.540 --> 28:20.240]  I feel like I've owned this.
[28:20.500 --> 28:21.960]  But I think that it's,
[28:23.680 --> 28:25.320]  I'm realizing now
[28:25.320 --> 28:27.320]  that I can bring Jacqueline
[28:27.320 --> 28:29.720]  outside to other people,
[28:29.920 --> 28:33.300]  but to Jean-Claude,
[28:33.500 --> 28:33.960]  to Scott,
[28:34.120 --> 28:34.400]  no.
[28:34.640 --> 28:36.480]  There's these huge walls
[28:36.480 --> 28:37.100]  of fear.
[28:38.140 --> 28:38.340]  Right.
[28:38.340 --> 28:40.180]  But if you can bring
[28:40.180 --> 28:40.980]  that part of you
[28:40.980 --> 28:41.840]  to other men,
[28:42.080 --> 28:43.080]  that's not because
[28:43.080 --> 28:44.100]  he doesn't have it.
[28:44.940 --> 28:45.920]  It's because you
[28:45.920 --> 28:46.980]  can't do it with him.
[28:47.580 --> 28:48.560]  Are we clear on that?
[28:49.440 --> 28:49.800]  Mmm.
[28:54.760 --> 28:55.820]  Jean-Claude has only
[28:55.820 --> 28:57.120]  recently come into the picture.
[28:57.340 --> 28:57.960]  That is true.
[28:58.260 --> 28:59.860]  And the other things
[28:59.860 --> 29:00.640]  I've experienced
[29:00.640 --> 29:01.300]  for the majority
[29:01.300 --> 29:02.160]  of her relationship
[29:02.160 --> 29:05.200]  has been different.
[29:05.200 --> 29:06.960]  It has been where
[29:06.960 --> 29:08.400]  I have exposed myself
[29:08.400 --> 29:10.000]  and more my true self
[29:10.000 --> 29:10.780]  and it was met
[29:10.780 --> 29:12.100]  with condemnation
[29:12.100 --> 29:12.840]  and shame
[29:12.840 --> 29:13.920]  and anger
[29:13.920 --> 29:15.060]  and shut down.
[29:15.280 --> 29:15.760]  So I have,
[29:15.840 --> 29:17.120]  I have very good reasons
[29:17.120 --> 29:17.960]  for why I feel
[29:17.960 --> 29:18.480]  the way I do.
[29:18.560 --> 29:19.360]  It's not all my fault.
[29:19.460 --> 29:19.920]  Not at all.
[29:20.040 --> 29:20.460]  Thank you.
[29:20.760 --> 29:21.120]  Thank you.
[29:21.160 --> 29:22.140]  He's nodding his head.
[29:22.360 --> 29:23.660]  So he's in agreement
[29:23.660 --> 29:24.100]  with you.
[29:25.040 --> 29:26.760]  Do you need Scott
[29:26.760 --> 29:28.740]  to acknowledge something?
[29:28.940 --> 29:29.620]  Do you need Scott
[29:29.620 --> 29:30.540]  to make amends?
[29:31.160 --> 29:31.600]  Yeah.
[29:31.600 --> 29:31.720]  Yeah.
[29:31.720 --> 29:35.560]  That was said
[29:35.560 --> 29:36.400]  without a doubt.
[29:38.520 --> 29:39.160]  So,
[29:39.460 --> 29:41.220]  have you ever?
[29:41.820 --> 29:42.640]  I guess not
[29:42.640 --> 29:43.260]  to the extent
[29:43.260 --> 29:44.260]  that she needs.
[29:45.660 --> 29:46.840]  I think I've
[29:46.840 --> 29:47.380]  acknowledged
[29:47.380 --> 29:48.100]  that I have
[29:48.100 --> 29:49.500]  my own problems.
[29:49.900 --> 29:50.080]  No.
[29:50.540 --> 29:51.160]  Be actually
[29:51.160 --> 29:52.300]  much more specific.
[29:52.940 --> 29:53.800]  When I
[29:53.800 --> 29:54.820]  said
[29:54.820 --> 29:55.440]  or did
[29:55.440 --> 29:56.080]  this
[29:56.080 --> 29:57.840]  and
[29:57.840 --> 29:58.720]  When I tell you
[29:58.720 --> 29:59.940]  sometimes
[29:59.940 --> 30:01.140]  when we're making love
[30:01.140 --> 30:02.060]  or trying to
[30:02.060 --> 30:03.000]  that
[30:03.000 --> 30:04.180]  you're too much
[30:04.180 --> 30:05.400]  or that
[30:05.400 --> 30:06.500]  I can't handle
[30:06.500 --> 30:07.840]  what you're asking me for.
[30:10.340 --> 30:11.700]  You must feel
[30:11.700 --> 30:13.340]  so unseen
[30:13.340 --> 30:15.000]  and so
[30:15.000 --> 30:16.600]  unwanted.
[30:18.980 --> 30:20.080]  And I'm sorry
[30:20.080 --> 30:20.600]  for that.
[30:22.900 --> 30:23.760]  Thank you.
[30:23.760 --> 30:26.580]  I've not felt
[30:26.580 --> 30:27.080]  safe
[30:27.080 --> 30:28.040]  or welcome
[30:28.040 --> 30:28.620]  to bring my
[30:28.620 --> 30:29.100]  false self
[30:29.100 --> 30:29.540]  to you.
[30:30.880 --> 30:31.100]  Well,
[30:31.140 --> 30:31.720]  Scott's a pretty
[30:31.720 --> 30:32.980]  emasculated person.
[30:34.820 --> 30:35.580]  What happens
[30:35.580 --> 30:35.960]  to him?
[30:36.560 --> 30:37.260]  What happens
[30:37.260 --> 30:38.780]  when she makes
[30:38.780 --> 30:39.420]  even a simple
[30:39.420 --> 30:40.000]  request?
[30:41.460 --> 30:42.280]  He feels
[30:42.280 --> 30:42.920]  obligated
[30:42.920 --> 30:43.940]  to fulfill it
[30:43.940 --> 30:44.620]  to
[30:44.620 --> 30:46.200]  the detriment
[30:46.200 --> 30:46.940]  of his own
[30:46.940 --> 30:47.280]  pleasure.
[30:47.860 --> 30:48.260]  He doesn't
[30:48.260 --> 30:48.680]  take care of
[30:48.680 --> 30:49.020]  himself.
[30:49.020 --> 30:50.740]  and then
[30:50.740 --> 30:51.380]  he loses
[30:51.380 --> 30:52.020]  interest in
[30:52.020 --> 30:52.240]  sex
[30:52.240 --> 30:52.720]  because he's
[30:52.720 --> 30:53.140]  not taking
[30:53.140 --> 30:53.540]  care of
[30:53.540 --> 30:53.860]  his own
[30:53.860 --> 30:54.160]  needs.
[30:55.940 --> 30:56.120]  So
[30:56.120 --> 30:56.440]  fulfilling
[30:56.440 --> 30:56.940]  the needs
[30:56.940 --> 30:57.480]  of a strong
[30:57.480 --> 30:57.760]  woman
[30:57.760 --> 30:58.140]  has been
[30:58.140 --> 30:58.740]  a big
[30:58.740 --> 30:59.560]  theme.
[30:59.560 --> 30:59.780]  Strong or
[30:59.780 --> 31:00.100]  needy?
[31:01.320 --> 31:01.920]  Is there
[31:01.920 --> 31:02.300]  a difference?
[31:02.880 --> 31:03.280]  Oh!
[31:05.660 --> 31:06.660]  My mother!
[31:07.720 --> 31:08.020]  Yeah,
[31:08.100 --> 31:08.500]  my mother
[31:08.500 --> 31:08.920]  was both
[31:08.920 --> 31:09.480]  strong and
[31:09.480 --> 31:09.800]  needy.
[31:10.040 --> 31:10.680]  That's true.
[31:11.760 --> 31:12.300]  So for me
[31:12.300 --> 31:12.700]  there has not
[31:12.700 --> 31:13.280]  been a difference.
[31:13.280 --> 31:16.900]  So when I
[31:16.900 --> 31:17.400]  see strength
[31:17.400 --> 31:17.980]  I also
[31:17.980 --> 31:18.420]  impute
[31:18.420 --> 31:18.740]  need
[31:18.740 --> 31:20.420]  or neediness.
[31:22.920 --> 31:23.380]  You're with
[31:23.380 --> 31:24.840]  somebody else
[31:24.840 --> 31:26.020]  at those
[31:26.020 --> 31:26.540]  moments.
[31:27.040 --> 31:27.380]  Sure.
[31:27.880 --> 31:28.140]  Yeah.
[31:28.360 --> 31:28.580]  No,
[31:28.660 --> 31:29.260]  there's definitely
[31:29.260 --> 31:29.720]  a different
[31:29.720 --> 31:30.240]  version of
[31:30.240 --> 31:30.740]  her inside
[31:30.740 --> 31:30.980]  of my
[31:30.980 --> 31:31.180]  head
[31:31.180 --> 31:32.280]  at those
[31:32.280 --> 31:32.620]  moments.
[31:32.840 --> 31:33.020]  Right.
[31:33.920 --> 31:34.440]  You're her
[31:34.440 --> 31:35.600]  father and
[31:35.600 --> 31:36.000]  she's your
[31:36.000 --> 31:36.260]  mother.
[31:37.200 --> 31:37.640]  Aha.
[31:38.180 --> 31:38.420]  Yeah.
[31:38.600 --> 31:39.040]  Who wants
[31:39.040 --> 31:39.340]  to have
[31:39.340 --> 31:39.740]  sex in
[31:39.740 --> 31:40.220]  the family?
[31:40.400 --> 31:40.760]  Exactly,
[31:40.920 --> 31:41.120]  right?
[31:41.180 --> 31:41.500]  It feels
[31:41.500 --> 31:42.040]  incestuous.
[31:42.040 --> 31:43.440]  I've always
[31:43.440 --> 31:44.060]  complained about
[31:44.060 --> 31:44.360]  that.
[31:45.000 --> 31:45.680]  I sometimes
[31:45.680 --> 31:45.980]  want to
[31:45.980 --> 31:46.380]  hit you
[31:46.380 --> 31:46.880]  because I
[31:46.880 --> 31:47.300]  just can't
[31:47.300 --> 31:48.300]  stand what
[31:48.300 --> 31:48.680]  I feel.
[31:48.780 --> 31:49.260]  It feels
[31:49.260 --> 31:50.220]  icky.
[31:50.420 --> 31:50.820]  Icky.
[31:51.080 --> 31:51.420]  Yes,
[31:51.580 --> 31:51.980]  it feels
[31:51.980 --> 31:52.360]  icky.
[31:53.020 --> 31:53.420]  And it
[31:53.420 --> 31:53.940]  doesn't feel
[31:53.940 --> 31:54.380]  icky to
[31:54.380 --> 31:54.660]  me.
[31:56.480 --> 31:56.880]  The
[31:56.880 --> 31:57.440]  closeness
[31:57.440 --> 31:59.060]  and the
[31:59.060 --> 31:59.540]  cuddling
[31:59.540 --> 32:00.400]  and the
[32:00.400 --> 32:01.740]  things that
[32:01.740 --> 32:02.220]  to her
[32:02.220 --> 32:02.600]  feel like
[32:02.600 --> 32:03.220]  family to
[32:03.220 --> 32:03.580]  me,
[32:04.000 --> 32:04.840]  that's where
[32:04.840 --> 32:05.720]  my sexuality
[32:05.720 --> 32:06.340]  begins.
[32:07.040 --> 32:07.480]  It comes
[32:07.480 --> 32:07.880]  out of a
[32:07.880 --> 32:08.380]  feeling of
[32:08.380 --> 32:08.840]  closeness
[32:08.840 --> 32:09.420]  and intimacy
[32:09.420 --> 32:09.960]  and then,
[32:10.100 --> 32:10.240]  oh,
[32:10.520 --> 32:11.040]  now let's
[32:11.040 --> 32:11.600]  be sexual.
[32:12.040 --> 32:14.160]  And then
[32:14.160 --> 32:15.000]  we're cuddling
[32:15.000 --> 32:15.580]  on the couch
[32:15.580 --> 32:16.120]  and you try
[32:16.120 --> 32:16.540]  to make it
[32:16.540 --> 32:17.080]  sexual and
[32:17.080 --> 32:17.380]  I'm like,
[32:17.480 --> 32:17.600]  oh,
[32:17.640 --> 32:17.940]  don't do
[32:17.940 --> 32:18.200]  this,
[32:18.360 --> 32:18.760]  don't do
[32:18.760 --> 32:18.940]  it,
[32:19.060 --> 32:19.340]  don't,
[32:19.340 --> 32:19.840]  don't make
[32:19.840 --> 32:19.980]  it,
[32:20.820 --> 32:21.240]  don't,
[32:21.440 --> 32:21.940]  I just,
[32:22.020 --> 32:22.540]  I get so
[32:22.540 --> 32:23.400]  resentful that
[32:23.400 --> 32:23.820]  you've taken
[32:23.820 --> 32:24.340]  this moment
[32:24.340 --> 32:24.780]  that felt
[32:24.780 --> 32:25.820]  safe and
[32:25.820 --> 32:27.580]  nurturing and
[32:27.580 --> 32:27.920]  turned it
[32:27.920 --> 32:28.300]  sexual.
[32:28.680 --> 32:29.160]  Whereas I
[32:29.160 --> 32:29.500]  want to be
[32:29.500 --> 32:29.940]  sexual from
[32:29.940 --> 32:31.040]  a place of
[32:31.040 --> 32:31.920]  anger and
[32:31.920 --> 32:34.000]  mystery and
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.600]  separateness.
[32:38.440 --> 32:39.000]  You want
[32:39.000 --> 32:39.320]  sex with
[32:39.320 --> 32:39.720]  Jean-Claude?
[32:39.720 --> 32:40.280]  Yes.
[32:40.840 --> 32:41.260]  Yes.
[32:41.460 --> 32:41.800]  And he?
[32:42.080 --> 32:42.520]  Who rides
[32:42.520 --> 32:43.120]  a motorcycle
[32:43.120 --> 32:45.020]  and, you
[32:45.020 --> 32:45.300]  know, has
[32:45.300 --> 32:45.640]  a lot of
[32:45.640 --> 32:46.240]  different women
[32:46.240 --> 32:47.460]  and a few
[32:47.460 --> 32:48.540]  men and
[32:48.540 --> 32:49.580]  is very
[32:49.580 --> 32:51.140]  independent
[32:51.140 --> 32:52.140]  and is not
[32:52.140 --> 32:52.700]  tied down to
[32:52.700 --> 32:53.300]  anyone and
[32:53.300 --> 32:53.880]  simply uses
[32:53.880 --> 32:54.420]  people for
[32:54.420 --> 32:54.840]  his pleasure.
[32:56.560 --> 32:57.140]  I'm going
[32:57.140 --> 32:57.640]  to challenge
[32:57.640 --> 32:57.960]  that.
[32:58.920 --> 32:59.560]  That's a
[32:59.560 --> 33:00.340]  caricature of
[33:00.340 --> 33:00.920]  Jean-Claude.
[33:01.960 --> 33:02.460]  Okay.
[33:02.460 --> 33:03.800]  And I,
[33:03.980 --> 33:04.500]  that's why I
[33:04.500 --> 33:05.020]  want you to
[33:05.020 --> 33:05.920]  think good
[33:05.920 --> 33:06.680]  and sexual.
[33:07.400 --> 33:07.940]  When you
[33:07.940 --> 33:08.720]  hold her hand
[33:08.720 --> 33:09.400]  before, when
[33:09.400 --> 33:10.000]  you hold her
[33:10.000 --> 33:10.700]  face before,
[33:11.020 --> 33:11.960]  it is utterly
[33:11.960 --> 33:13.160]  caring.
[33:14.860 --> 33:16.040]  But also very
[33:16.040 --> 33:17.320]  present and also
[33:17.320 --> 33:18.000]  very pleasure
[33:18.000 --> 33:18.660]  focused.
[33:20.100 --> 33:20.520]  Unless I'm
[33:20.520 --> 33:20.540]  just kidding.
[33:20.540 --> 33:21.520]  Je préfère être
[33:21.520 --> 33:21.980]  Jean-Claude.
[33:22.120 --> 33:23.040]  Je préfère...
[33:23.040 --> 33:23.620]  Mais Jean-Claude
[33:23.620 --> 33:24.500]  peut donner aussi.
[33:24.860 --> 33:25.360]  Peu, oh.
[33:26.180 --> 33:27.060]  Jean-Claude aussi
[33:27.060 --> 33:27.480]  peut donner.
[33:27.540 --> 33:28.740]  Oui, oui, c'est...
[33:28.740 --> 33:29.040]  Are you
[33:29.040 --> 33:29.640]  flirting with her?
[33:29.640 --> 33:32.640]  Non.
[33:33.840 --> 33:34.220]  Non.
[33:34.440 --> 33:35.300]  Seulement avec toi.
[33:36.320 --> 33:37.140]  Only with you.
[33:41.560 --> 33:42.600]  And all I feel
[33:42.600 --> 33:43.260]  bubbling up
[33:43.260 --> 33:43.820]  are all these
[33:43.820 --> 33:44.800]  excuses of why
[33:44.800 --> 33:45.380]  I can't be
[33:45.380 --> 33:46.000]  Jacqueline and
[33:46.000 --> 33:46.800]  why it's wrong
[33:46.800 --> 33:47.340]  and why you
[33:47.340 --> 33:47.840]  can't let that
[33:47.840 --> 33:48.120]  out.
[33:48.300 --> 33:48.560]  Okay.
[33:49.200 --> 33:49.940]  Is there music
[33:49.940 --> 33:50.840]  Jacqueline likes?
[33:51.520 --> 33:52.160]  She loves
[33:52.160 --> 33:52.860]  French music.
[33:52.940 --> 33:53.400]  Edith Pia.
[33:55.440 --> 33:56.300]  Any particular
[33:56.300 --> 33:56.680]  song?
[33:57.620 --> 33:58.620]  Um...
[33:59.640 --> 34:01.080]  Je ne regrette rien.
[34:01.260 --> 34:01.580]  Yes.
[34:01.740 --> 34:01.900]  Yeah.
[34:04.080 --> 34:05.100]  Does she sing it?
[34:05.680 --> 34:06.640]  I don't sing it
[34:06.640 --> 34:07.040]  in French.
[34:07.100 --> 34:07.800]  No, I don't know it.
[34:08.340 --> 34:09.540]  And as they told me
[34:09.540 --> 34:10.380]  that it was a song
[34:10.380 --> 34:11.600]  by Piaf and it was
[34:11.600 --> 34:12.820]  Non, je ne regrette rien,
[34:13.220 --> 34:14.860]  I knew the song
[34:14.860 --> 34:15.460]  for one.
[34:15.840 --> 34:16.740]  And so I had my
[34:16.740 --> 34:17.840]  moment of recognition
[34:17.840 --> 34:19.720]  and then I did
[34:19.720 --> 34:20.400]  something that I
[34:20.400 --> 34:20.880]  never do.
[34:21.040 --> 34:21.520]  I sang.
[34:21.520 --> 34:30.600]  Non, je ne regrette rien
[34:30.600 --> 34:34.900]  Ni le mal
[34:34.900 --> 34:38.640]  qu'on m'a fait
[34:38.640 --> 34:42.040]  Ni le bien
[34:42.040 --> 34:44.660]  Tout cela m'est bien
[34:44.660 --> 34:45.280]  égal
[34:45.280 --> 34:49.400]  It's actually very apt
[34:49.400 --> 34:50.220]  for what you've
[34:50.220 --> 34:50.820]  experienced.
[34:50.980 --> 34:51.440]  Do you know what
[34:51.440 --> 34:51.880]  she's saying?
[34:52.200 --> 34:53.120]  No regret, right?
[34:53.300 --> 34:55.020]  I regret not the bad,
[34:55.160 --> 34:56.240]  the evil that was
[34:56.240 --> 34:56.920]  done to me.
[34:57.100 --> 34:57.340]  Oh.
[34:57.340 --> 34:58.360]  The pain that was
[34:58.360 --> 34:59.120]  caused to me.
[35:01.620 --> 35:02.360]  That's why I'm
[35:02.360 --> 35:03.220]  singing it for you.
[35:03.220 --> 35:03.260]  Oh.
[35:03.260 --> 35:03.300]  Oh.
[35:03.300 --> 35:03.360]  Oh.
[35:03.360 --> 35:03.400]  Oh.
[35:03.400 --> 35:03.860]  Oh.
[35:03.860 --> 35:03.900]  Oh.
[35:03.900 --> 35:03.960]  Oh.
[35:03.960 --> 35:04.320]  Oh.
[35:04.320 --> 35:04.460]  Oh.
[35:04.460 --> 35:04.520]  Oh.
[35:04.520 --> 35:05.000]  Oh.
[35:05.000 --> 35:05.060]  Oh.
[35:05.060 --> 35:05.100]  Oh.
[35:05.100 --> 35:05.500]  Oh.
[35:05.500 --> 35:06.000]  Oh.
[35:06.000 --> 35:06.060]  Oh.
[35:06.060 --> 35:06.100]  Oh.
[35:06.100 --> 35:06.140]  Oh.
[35:06.140 --> 35:06.560]  Oh.
[35:06.560 --> 35:06.600]  Oh.
[35:06.600 --> 35:06.660]  Oh.
[35:06.660 --> 35:07.100]  Oh.
[35:07.100 --> 35:07.140]  Oh.
[35:07.140 --> 35:08.100]  Oh.
[35:08.100 --> 35:08.600]  Oh.
[35:08.600 --> 35:09.100]  Oh.
[35:09.100 --> 35:09.140]  Oh.
[35:09.140 --> 35:10.100]  Oh.
[35:10.100 --> 35:11.100]  Oh.
[35:11.100 --> 35:12.100]  Oh.
[35:12.100 --> 35:13.100]  Oh.
[35:13.100 --> 35:13.700]  Oh.
[35:13.700 --> 35:14.200]  So here's going to
[35:14.200 --> 35:15.020]  be a challenge.
[35:15.960 --> 35:17.200]  When she gets upset,
[35:17.680 --> 35:18.960]  which is totally normal,
[35:20.580 --> 35:21.320]  you will learn to
[35:21.320 --> 35:22.100]  comfort each other
[35:22.100 --> 35:22.820]  as adults
[35:22.820 --> 35:26.180]  and not as one child
[35:26.180 --> 35:27.020]  and one adult.
[35:28.280 --> 35:29.340]  Jean-Claude can comfort.
[35:30.060 --> 35:30.840]  He can tell her
[35:30.840 --> 35:31.520]  a few things
[35:31.520 --> 35:34.300]  and we don't have to go
[35:34.300 --> 35:35.220]  and spend
[35:35.220 --> 35:36.820]  the entire evening there.
[35:37.700 --> 35:38.640]  And then we need
[35:38.640 --> 35:39.400]  a different song.
[35:41.100 --> 35:42.000]  I'm sorry.
[35:44.160 --> 35:45.140]  Could be Piaf,
[35:45.200 --> 35:46.280]  but it can't be this way.
[35:49.140 --> 35:49.880]  Because we're not
[35:49.880 --> 35:50.720]  going to sing trauma.
[35:53.200 --> 35:54.020]  It's almost like
[35:54.020 --> 35:54.640]  there's a switch
[35:54.640 --> 35:55.380]  inside of me
[35:55.380 --> 35:57.300]  that I allow
[35:57.300 --> 35:57.900]  the child
[35:57.900 --> 35:58.680]  to feel the pain,
[35:58.920 --> 35:59.860]  but I don't always
[35:59.860 --> 36:00.620]  allow the adult
[36:00.620 --> 36:01.340]  to feel pleasure.
[36:02.340 --> 36:03.760]  So what you want
[36:03.760 --> 36:04.700]  is to help
[36:04.700 --> 36:05.900]  each other stay.
[36:07.500 --> 36:07.980]  Stay
[36:07.980 --> 36:09.760]  with these other
[36:09.760 --> 36:11.600]  parts of you
[36:11.600 --> 36:12.440]  that are,
[36:13.300 --> 36:13.920]  they're there.
[36:14.080 --> 36:14.960]  They just don't,
[36:15.280 --> 36:16.340]  they have not been
[36:16.340 --> 36:17.340]  given much permission.
[36:18.460 --> 36:18.820]  So,
[36:19.140 --> 36:21.140]  don't make a long speech.
[36:21.420 --> 36:22.420]  Just basically say,
[36:22.660 --> 36:25.240]  I'm having unwanted guests.
[36:25.800 --> 36:28.020]  Or something very short
[36:28.020 --> 36:29.300]  that just cues,
[36:29.920 --> 36:30.620]  help me stay.
[36:31.040 --> 36:32.200]  Help me be in the present.
[36:32.800 --> 36:33.740]  Go put some lipstick.
[36:33.740 --> 36:35.840]  If you start
[36:35.840 --> 36:36.960]  to wander away
[36:36.960 --> 36:38.260]  and I feel you,
[36:39.100 --> 36:40.220]  I can call you back.
[36:40.720 --> 36:41.480]  I would like that.
[36:41.540 --> 36:42.660]  And you can call me out.
[36:43.020 --> 36:44.240]  You can call me out of,
[36:44.240 --> 36:44.860]  out of the,
[36:44.860 --> 36:46.280]  out of the forest.
[36:47.560 --> 36:48.400]  So when
[36:48.400 --> 36:50.580]  the wires get crossed,
[36:51.520 --> 36:53.140]  you simply tell him,
[36:53.700 --> 36:56.880]  speak to me in French.
[36:57.680 --> 36:58.940]  Speak to me in French.
[36:58.940 --> 37:13.400]  This was an adult version
[37:13.400 --> 37:15.180]  of imaginary play.
[37:16.420 --> 37:17.820]  The therapy itself
[37:17.820 --> 37:19.340]  is a new experience
[37:19.340 --> 37:20.720]  closer to the one
[37:20.720 --> 37:21.280]  that the people
[37:21.280 --> 37:21.820]  want to have.
[37:21.900 --> 37:22.900]  It mirrors it.
[37:23.700 --> 37:24.140]  Of course,
[37:24.280 --> 37:25.720]  it's not a one session only.
[37:25.860 --> 37:27.060]  I know they can go home
[37:27.060 --> 37:27.660]  and lose it,
[37:27.720 --> 37:28.720]  which is why I said,
[37:29.320 --> 37:29.540]  you know,
[37:29.560 --> 37:30.340]  you're going to slip.
[37:32.100 --> 37:33.460]  It's how you teach people
[37:33.460 --> 37:34.900]  to stay in the story.
[37:35.440 --> 37:36.200]  Another story,
[37:36.320 --> 37:37.240]  because they're in the story.
[37:37.360 --> 37:38.560]  They're just in a stuck story
[37:38.560 --> 37:39.300]  of their life
[37:39.300 --> 37:40.260]  about to divorce.
[37:42.220 --> 37:43.360]  This couple doesn't need
[37:43.360 --> 37:44.380]  to divorce at all.
[37:44.740 --> 37:45.280]  At all.
[37:45.360 --> 37:46.020]  This is a couple
[37:46.020 --> 37:47.560]  that has everything in them
[37:47.560 --> 37:50.220]  to claim this part of them.
[37:50.320 --> 37:51.020]  They deserve it.
[37:51.080 --> 37:52.160]  They're entitled to it.
