cooking.\nYou understand?\nI understand.\nI understand."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner A]: I understand that he wasn't happy with it.\nDo you know why?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "No.\nOkay.\nThen you're not listening.\nBecause you're listening and you're basically inside of you saying that's not who I am.\nThat's not how I see myself.\nI think of myself as a very sexual woman.\nI'm a very sensual woman.\nWhat is he talking about?\nThis is not me.\nIt is not me.\nRight.\nBut that's not what he's talking about.\nSo I don't understand why it happens like this between us.\nBecause on all other levels...\nBecause you're not listening."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner A]: But he never told me that.\nBut he's telling me right now.\nOkay.\nAnd it's good.\nHe's going to continue.\nHe's insisting.\nBecause he cares about the subject enough that this one he's going to fight for.\nOf course he cares.\nIt just matters."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "He's not getting any sex.\nThat's got nothing to do with it.\nAnd it's good.\nHe's insisting.\nHe cares about the subject enough that this one he's going to fight for.\nOf course he cares.\nIt just matters.\nHe's not getting any sex.\nNothing to do with it.\nYou see, the issue is...\nWhat he's actually trying to tell you...\nIs that your notion of giving it to him...\nShoving it down.\nMaking sure he comes as fast as possible so it's done with."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner A]: I hate it.\nThat's what he hates.\nThat's not true.\n[Partner B]: It is true.\n[Partner A]: That's what it became.\nBecause...\nI would never come.\nHe doesn't care.\nHe would take me.\nI did care.\nCome in five minutes and leave me.\nThis is our sex life.\nI mean, did you have good sex with me before we got married?\nOf course."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Yeah."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner A]: Did you?\nIt was good enough.\n[Partner B]: I don't know what that means.\n[Partner A]: It was good.\nBut...\nI don't know.\nFor the most part it was good."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Say more.\nI've had better."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner A]: But...\nI didn't think that that would be so important.\n[Partner B]: Before we had kids, before we were married, I mean it was totally different.\nI didn't...\nAlso didn't like the five minutes of sex.\nIt was terrible.\nWhy did you do it?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Why did you?\nYou did it.\nI didn't plan for five minutes.\nYou thought that's what I need to give him.\nNo, no.\nAnd he did it because he thought that's what I can get.\nI don't think it's true.\nI didn't want it to be five minutes.\nBut he was done in five minutes and gone.\nAnd then nobody said, stay."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner A]: He's tired.\nI'm tired.\nI want to go to sleep.\nHe doesn't want to have sex at night.\nHe wants to have sex in the morning."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "It can be like a long romantic sex in the morning, right?\nWhy not rent a hotel and start with that?"}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner A]: To me like when you like are renting a hotel in your city to have sex, it's like a long romantic\nsex in the morning, right?\nWhy not rent a hotel and start with that?\n[Partner B]: To me like when you like are renting a hotel in your city to have sex, I just can't do it like that.\n[Partner A]: You did it with the girl.\n[Partner B]: It wasn't, but it was more, it was more about just the excitement of-\nAll right."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Let me stop you a second, people.\nBecause you don't tell him much.\nHe doesn't tell you much.\nYou let this thing degrade, both of you.\nYou're a year into the discovery of the affair.\nAnd so we're not in the crisis mode.\nWe're not.\nBut the second phase is what I call the insight.\nIt is the meaning making.\nWhy did this happen?\nHow did this happen?\nWhat did it mean for you?\nWhat did you find there?\nIt's a both end.\nIt's what happened to you and what happened to us.\nAnd what can we learn from it?\nAnd how did we allow ourselves to enter a place where we both were quite unhappy?\nNeither of us really felt the other person is going to hear it, is going to take it, is going to receive it.\nJust like that, without instantly switching into a blame mode.\nBlame and defense.\nThat's the conversation I hear you're trying to have.\nIt doesn't really matter if it's around sex or about something else.\nThe form is the same.\nOnce you have this kind of pattern, just about every conversation will go in the same direction."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner B]: I do feel like all of our conversations, you get very defensive.\nThat like I'm trying to say something negative about you, but I'm not.\nI'm trying to just tell you sort of my view on it.\nIt doesn't mean it's right.\nIt's just what I feel."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So here's the way you can tweak that.\nShe already told you, I was doing something that didn't feel good, but I was doing it for you.\nSo when you talk to her, include that.\nNeither you liked it nor I liked it.\nAnd then it becomes a we statement.\nThat's what I mean by integrating the experience of the other.\nOkay.\nAnd then she can do the same.\nYou know, here I was trying to be nice and to please you.\nLittle did I know that that wasn't even what you wanted.\nAnd then you can say, that's not the woman I remember.\nSo then she doesn't have to say that's not who I am.\nAnd then it's less polarized.\nThen you're not talking from the extremes.\nThe minute you put yourself on the extreme, the other person will defend themselves."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner A]: What do I have to do different in the way I communicate?\nWhat do I have to do different?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "That's a beautiful question, first of all."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner B]: I wish that you would hopefully just kind of listen to what I'm saying without immediately feeling like I'm attacking you.\nBecause I promise I'm, it's not my intention with whatever I'm saying to be attacking you.\nI'm just trying to tell you my viewpoint.\n[Partner A]: But I think I do now."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "She just caught herself.\nGood.\nIt's very rare that I just make a blanket statement like this.\nYour communication is terrible.\nI never knew that.\nI thought we're really good at communicating.\nYes.\nWell, that doesn't mean as a whole.\nBut this thing that I'm watching here is at the root of a lot of what happens.\nAnd happened."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner A]: Is that because we're coming from different backgrounds and view things differently?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I don't know how much I would put it on culture as much I would put it on your family cultures and your experiences that you had.\nI do see that it wasn't good for both of you and that conversation needs to take place.\nNot what was wrong, but how you change this, how you learn sexual communication."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner A]: I just cannot do that anymore.\nCase closed sexually.\nLike I just can't.\nSomething shut down.\nSo here's the idea."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I don't know what your relationship is like sexually.\nBut I have a sense for both of you.\nIt's been massively outcome driven, rather unimaginative, too fast for both of you, and unsatisfying.\nIt's terrible to be with a man who you feel is only pleasing himself, and it's terrible to be with a woman who you feel is just giving you pity sex.\nSo no matter what's going to happen, the first thing is touch.\nHow you touch each other, how you stroke each other, how you kiss each other, and zero outcome.\nThat's plenty of outcome."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner A]: But isn't this thing supposed to happen naturally?\nWhy is it supposed to be worse?\nWhere the hell did you learn that BS?\nWhy is that supposed to be work?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "The myth that sex is natural has done harm to so many people because it presumes that you should just know, rather than the fact that it is something that we learn to appreciate, to experience, we cultivate it.\nIt's an art.\nAnd that if you think it's natural, then in fact you often remain ignorant.\nSo here's what I would like to suggest to you.\nYou're going to do it in writing.\nThat was our best way of communication actually, right?\nWhen we start texting to each other, we could communicate."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner A]: So you're going to take out a separate email address that nobody else knows."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "It is the one that is reserved for the couple.\nNot for the parents, not for the professionals, for the role of you as partner and lover.\nAnd you're going to just talk to each other.\nAnd there's a certain kind of intimacy that you have not experienced in a long time."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner A]: I totally agree with you.\nAnd I think it's amazing and it's great and it would totally work.\nBut that would be a while ago.\nWhat if right now I don't even want to do that?\nSo what do I do?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I think you need more from him and him from you for that matter to know how bad he felt.\nIt has less to do with what he did with the other woman.\nYeah.\nAnd more to do with what you did for him that you didn't want to do to begin with.\nThat's the betrayal.\nYeah.\nDo you understand?\nMm-hmm.\nDo you want him to repeat it?\nI want him to repeat it."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner B]: I can repeat it.\nYou're angry with me not so much because of what happened with the other girl,\nbut because you felt that you did certain things and I ultimately didn't appreciate those things\nand then went and sought them somewhere else.\nIt did happen.\nI'm sorry that it happened.\nI didn't want it to happen.\nAnd I think that sometimes it just felt like our clocks were off.\nAnd so when I wanted to have sex and you..."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Let me help you.\nOkay.\nHe's not better at this than you. Just so you.\nYou see, what she needs to hear from you is to be left there feeling nothing and just feeling like she's some vessel in which you get to empty yourself is a terrible feeling.\nAnd you need to talk to that."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner B]: No, I shouldn't have done that.\nI'm sorry that I made you feel the way that you did, the way that you do now.\nAnd especially to think that I'm the reason for it.\nAnd yeah, it's the worst feeling you can imagine.\n[Partner A]: Do you actually understand that or are you just saying it?\n[Partner B]: I mean it.\n[Partner A]: Do you understand what happened?\n[Partner B]: I think so.\n[Partner A]: Because I don't think you do."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Ask her what's most important for you to understand."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner B]: Can you tell me what it is that you feel is the most important thing for me to understand that maybe you think I don't?\n[Partner A]: I feel used.\nI feel like our whole marriage is just me running around your needs and you never try.\nLike I know that you think by providing that you did your part.\nBut I'm talking more about emotional things.\n[Partner B]: I've been trying to show you that.\nI don't know if I've been doing a good job of it.\n[Partner A]: You've been much better in terms of how you're at home.\nYou're involved with the kids.\nIt more feels like a family more now.\nBut the love thing between us, that I don't know how to bring back."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "So one of the ways it comes back is when you do have the feeling that he gets it.\nWhat does it mean to say I feel used?\nHmm?\nThat doesn't mean it's all what he did.\nI understand.\nHmm?\nAnd a part of why it went so long, if I may, is because you did absorb some very old patriarchal notions of I have to give it to him.\nBecause that's what men need."}, {"from": "human", "value": "[Partner A]: That's part of like how we raised in Eastern Europe."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "That is culture.\nCatered to men.\nYeah.\nCatered to them.\nYou just give it to them.\nAnd he doesn't want you to just give it to him.\nThe conversation will be primarily on each of you having the experience that the other person gets it.\nAnd that you can together say, what happened to us?\nWhat did we do?\nVersus you did this and you did that.\nDon't let this sit.\nAnd don't think time is going to do all of it.\nIt needs attention.\nYour kids are watching you.\nThey're learning from you.\nWhen I talk about how dissatisfying their respective experiences have been, both in terms of the emotional intimacy and in terms of the sexual connection, this is the one place where they actually meet.\nAnd then from here, it's about understanding the particular details of their respective experience.\nIn my work with this couple, I'm not looking for a happy denouement.\nAnd while they become at the same time very sad, they also are perhaps speaking more to each other than they have in a long time.\nAnd they're speaking to truth more than they have in a long time.\nAnd perhaps this is the most we will be able to do today in this one session that I will have had with this couple."}]}
