You know, because as a partnership, we cannot, you know, co-parent with someone else with those two conversations happening. [Partner B]: Or either of those conversations happening. [Partner A]: Either. And, um, I think the value of today was you uncovered something we weren't even looking at on both sides. You know, we were both looking to compensate. So, this gives us a lot of clarity."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Your transition to parenthood has started. It's easy to imagine that the transition to parenthood starts when people expect a child. But in fact, the transition to parenthood begins when one starts the process of expanding one's identity. When I say to them, a child you will have if a child you want. It is something that I learned in working with a lot of couples who are struggling with infertility. Because the hopefulness of having children is that you can bring a child into your life. You may not bring your child that is biologically yours, genetically yours, that even you give birth to. But you can raise a child. You may have to go through a series of mourning processes and grieving and acceptance of opportunities that you won't have. But that then opened the door to other opportunities that you hadn't considered. It may not be your biological child. It may not even be your genetic child. But it will be a child you will raise for whom you will be the parent. You may not be the parent."}]}
