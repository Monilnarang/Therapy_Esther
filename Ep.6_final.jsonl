And I'll help you with that. I can put things aside and say, let's hang. It's harder for her. Help her. And she may argue a little bit. Yeah, but I need to, it's important. And you just say, I know, I know. It's very important. But so is this. You had a beautiful thing. You said, there's me, there's you, there's us. Us needs this now. Us needs an electricity bill that's paid. Us needs nice sheets on the bed. And us needs now some attention. Us needs a little bit. So she tends to a zillion projects. You tend for the idol. She will thank you. She's already thanking you. Much of what I do in the session is about loosening the breaks. So I send them off with an exercise in which they would write down the positive anticipation so that when they're about to put the foot on the brake and come up with all the negative cognitions about the anticipated rejection rather than the anticipated connection, they can go back and look at their own list and remember that they have an alternative right there in front of them. But the importance of the exercise is the understanding that it's a practice and you do it even when you're not really in need of it. See, we all know that when we go to the doctor and we are in pain, we are very motivated. I'm doing all my back exercises, you know, every day now. And the minute it starts to feel a little bit better, I do them less often. So the paradox here is that we have a greater incentive for change when we are more in pain or even when there is a crisis, but we have greater latitude for creativity when we are doing fine. And you want to uphold these two. So for this couple, the idea is to shift them from a place of crisis to a place of positive maintenance."}]}
